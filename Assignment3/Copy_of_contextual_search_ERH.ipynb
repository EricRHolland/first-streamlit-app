tumultuous time   the location is ideal if you arrive in paris by train gare du nord is verythis hotel is excellent  its location right opposite the gare du nord was highly convenient for eurostar  our room at the front directly faced the station and we enjoyed sitting on the balcony admiring its grand architecture  all that wonderful sculpture  our room was very comfortable and the decor was interestingly quirky  excellent and quiet airconditioning too so we slept very well  the staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble  the new manager was charming and enthusiastic  he permitted us to leave luggage there after checkout and to continue using the hotel facilities  we intend to return next time in paris  it was a real treatgreat hotel with really friendly staff fun quirky rooms which make great use of space even in the smallest room   great location just seconds from the eurostar   only suggestion would be to install some international sockets and possibly to replace the light switches with something less confusingdue to a mountain of online bureaucracy in order to return to the uk via eurostar we had to stay overnight in paris  this hotel was recommended by a helpful staff member what a find clean comfortable very eco friendly with a super restaurant  i couldnt find a fault lovely helpful staff on the desk and in the restaurant  i plan to return when less harassed highly recommended and opposite the station for an early train journey perfectwhile it may not be as entertaining as other 25hours properties this one is certainly the most convenient as it sits directly across from gare du nord so if you have an early train departure or flight from cdg via rer b this hotel would be a logical choice however it doesnt have as many fun common spaces for the guests to simply hang out while the hotel does feature a requisite neni restaurant that serves sumptuous breakfasts and great dinners and an adjacent plush hipster bar it offers few additional amenities such as lounges with comfortable sofas or mini libraries for the guests to browse but then again you are after all in the middle of paris and the metro is literally at your front door it may be wrong to be wasting your time in a hotel no matter howthe hotel is modern and slightly quirky the room was adequate size but not overly big it was furnished with a comfortable bed and desk a hanging rail for clothes but not a wardrobe   the bathroom was clean and had a good shower tv wifi and mini fridge  close to the station for trains and metroabsolutely loved this hotel right by the station so great for people arriving by the eurostar the room was a good size with a lovely walk in shower perfect for a 3 night stay  the decor is also really funky so great for picture opportunities we had a continental breakfast one morning which was nice lots of food to choose from the service in the hotel was fantastic the guy who worked in the bar called william was very friendly made us lovely hand made drinks and gave some great recommendations  would defiantly go backfantastic hotel pictures do not do it justice all staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome especially md on reception such a friendly yet professional person the best personality to have at front desk will be coming back to stay when we are next in paris thank yougreat quirky hotel decorvery modern young staff excellent with fleur a star supervisor location perfect for eurostar arrival from the uk and the metro outside the front door was able to check straight into our room at 930 ami loved this hotel ive  traveled all over the world and this has to be my favorite one thus far great staff awesome location walking distance like 50 feet from all public transportation i hope to return again one daycolourful world of cultures in the midst of the 10th district of paris the 25hours hotel terminus nord is located in the heart of the city and really one of the best hotels that i have stayed in parisi booked this hotel for 4 nights and because of the us travel ban my girlfriend and i had no choice but to leave after only 2 nights i emailed the hotel manager to see if i could either get a refund or credit for the 2 nights that i did not stay there and they outright said no  first of all this hotel is not in the best neighborhood in paris and everything is a 20 to 30 minute walk  with all of the hotel choices in paris this is not a great place to stay25hours hotel terminus nord is a hip hotel that features vibrant and stylish rooms the interior design is unique and colorful the hotel also features magnificent facilities that provided us the muchneeded comfort and convenience while we were the city 25hours hotel terminus nord also has a strategic location it is situated directly opposite the gare du nord train station making the hotel an ideal starting point for us to explore paris  we stayed at a large plus room with a balcony facing the train station it was a hotel room like what we wanted for this vacation in paris the balcony has the view of the street and gare du nord the room has a kingsize bed and other thoughtful amenities  our two nights at the hotel was a pleasant stay to remember we had a stylish room3 nights spent here last weekend and i will definitely be back  everything about this hotel was great the staff the room the cleanliness the wifi the breakfast and the location   i cant find a single bad thing to say and wouldnt hesitate to recommend  revisitwe stayed here for a long weekend in july 2020  this hotel is only seconds from gare de nord and so was in a fantastic location for our eurostar arrival and departure as well as for getting metro and rer trains around town it is also only just over 5 minutes walk from gare de lest station we are huge fans of the 25 hours brand and regularly stay at hotels in the chain and this one lived up to our expected standards despite the weirdness of the covid precautions we got a deal that included breakfast and the food and service were great our favourites  were guacamole and also the omelette which we got in addition to continental style bread and jam and pastries really friendly staff at reception the theme style and decoration of the hotel is a bit eccentric but overallvery convenient location great concept and atmosphere in the public areas we really liked the room with big and comfortable bed our baby spent also a great night there breakfast was really good too we will come back   thank younot my favourite 25hours of which i know but ok location in front of gare du nord is a bit rough and loud but this is not influencing my review because its not the fault of the hotel and it is convenient when you travel with eg the thalys train the house in which the hotel is located is very beautiful   corona rules make sense and are easy to adapt except that you can not leave your luggage there that does not make sense and you could organise this without contact to the customerluggage i assume its a manpower saving measurement  but why is service at breakfast that slow and understaffed even if the house was not full that makes no sense and is annoying the employees are really very nice and helpful and thats also not nice for them because customers getthe 25 hours hotel terminus nord was the perfect place to start and end my trip to paris i travelled on the eurostar from london and it is literally across the road from gare du nord station so it took just minutes to get from the train to my room the area itself is very buzzy with lots of great restaurants and cafes nearby its also walking distance from plenty of the sights of paris i loved exploring montmarte and the sacre coer from the hotel i also walked to notre dame and the eiffel tower from the hotel though this is a longer walk  the hotel is very trendy and has a really contemporary boutique feel with lots of mismatched furniture and kitch artworks throughout my room was large with balconies overflowing with gorgeous geraniums and wonderful parisian views thei know this super cool hofman gang always coll smile and chilled  make no mistak they work very hardthey all wake up an hour earlier i know i wake up 2 hours and see them paris is even an amazing value been in an ihg before no wifi and almost dbl price then doria and her gang cant beat thatthe reception was well organised for check in the room was quite small although classed as a medium the bed was comfortable and warm there was little space to walk passed the bottom of the bed due to a shelf the tv on the wall was enclosed in doors which did not fold completely back to the wall i felt this was a hazard and did i fact bang my shoulder walking passed the bathroom was nice and had a separate toilet due to restrictions regarding covid 19 no room cleaning was available fully understandable they did supply fresh towels on request and did in fact remake our bed twice the only issue i have regards this arrangement was that they did not supply the room with any products for cleaning the toilet  the breakfast was disjointed and a bit disorganised',\n",

persons in a business trip excellent location for us in this trip and good help from the hotel to find good restaurants and to help in general had good food all days not their fault how difficult it is to get taxis at rush hours in paris well situated clean and nice even though the rooms are small like they are so often in paris simple but fine breakfast my only negative comments is that they served cheese in small doses wrapped in plastic at breakfast i would like to see the plastic disappear but all in all i will come back it we have meetings in the same place next yearreception staff was exceedingly cooperative with room changes and dinner bookings air conditioning could be better as airflowcirculation is insufficient please note that lift is very small 3 pax maximumvery near arc

              " 'stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect  this hotel is a bit diy with complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing  the hotel decor is qwerky cool and classy whilst the rooms are cosey and just right for a short stay  staff were more than happy to accommodate our request of a balcony over looking the city roof tops and flowers as a surprise for my partner  thejust stayed 2 nights in this hotel and i loved its simplicity style location staff room lounge area and breakfast the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day tired and hungry there was a small selection of wholesome snacks as they dont have cooking facilities and the food has to be preorderedwe saw others eating it and it looked delicious  again wholesome and home made i hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy parisienne hotels strangely the staff were lovely all of them an achievement in paris where redness seems to be norm braviits pretty obvious the vast majority of reviews of this hotel on the internet are written by the management at first it comes off as chic in an odd way but then its clear its more about marketing than the hotel itself there are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message be a good part of the community   true the room are cute like many boutique hotels its designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel the bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds however i was shocked when i arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room ive ever stayed in you have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it the door to the toilet doesnt even fully open thiswe absolutely loved our stay at coq hotel all the cute carefully considered little details extremely comfy bed pleasing shower and beautiful big window with a french balcony were just some reasons why we absolutely fell in love with this hotel it made our stay in paris even more memorable3we loved everything about our stay  the hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish the room amenities are good including lovely toiletries and everything you need for a short stay the service was great  warm and welcoming and it is well located for metro lineswe had a brilliant stay at this hotel on our long weekend to paris it is really well decorated we loved our room massive comfy bed huge shower gorgeous carpet all very much to our tastes we got a really good deal that include a welcome drink which included a few glasses of good wine and super yummy popcorn the location is good near place ditalie so walkable to the left bank breakfast was fabulous really good quality produce the bread and butter was to die for lovely staff too we loved our stay so much we even bought a bottle of their wine as a souvenirwould definitely recommend had a room with a balcony overlooking paris rooftops breakfast is fantastic lots of choice of high quality products decor was modern and trendy and rooms were excellent sizeits hard to find enough superlatives for this hotel right from the check in to the check out we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff the room was small  as expected in paris  but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom everything was in good condition the breakfast was great not the biggest selection but quality items slightly cramped at times  a little wait for a table to be expected nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet and then i have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass  knives and forks etc through to make sure it was perfectly clean  as it was at a michelin starred restaurant would love to stay here again another timewe stayed at the coq hotel for 4 nights in mid may it was as good as the photos and reviews suggest stylish but not pretentious friendly helpful service and a substantial breakfast   we upgraded to the superior room for extra space staying in such a special place we looked forward to coming back to the 13 arrondissement every evening after long days sightseeing in the citythis is without doubt one of the best located hotels we have stayed at in paris location is perfect for walking five minutes from metro with multiple lines converging so no part of paris is out of reach staff are wonderful along with very well maintained and clean premises could not be faultedthis is a lovely hotel the rooms are charming in a minimalist way clean and with plenty of natural light the rooms have windows that can be opened the hotel has an intimate feel yet there is plenty of public space to relax or do work its location close to the place ditalie provides good access to public transport and the staff were helpful in providing information on how to get around the staff are friendly energetic polite wellinformed and speak some english the 24 hour availability of light food options and a machine for tea and coffee is especially welcome the breakfast options are good and the staff accommodated my dietary needs punctually and without fuss  i had an extended stay for work and would certainly stay again this is a gem of a placewe loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for its friendly staff comfortable beds lovely rooms and amazing breakfasts very relaxed and comfortable and well placed in terms of metro station a place ditalie we paid for a larger room which is not so big but this is paris and for the price we paid the size and atmosphere of the room was very fair very large and comfortable bed the bathroom had a bad but no separate shower parking is easy in the neighbourghood and if you like to park in a paid garage prices are 14th the price of more central parisi thoroughly enjoyed my 3night stay at coq hotel in a quieter part of paris conveniently located nearby the place ditalie station with 3 metro lines  the classique room size is standard for paris hotels  it is the thoughtful use of space and design that actually makes staying at this hotel a truly pleasant experience equally the staff were very welcoming and always willing to help delivering quality service  the breakfast at the hotel is lovely and there are also some good food options in the 13eme arr for dinner nearby after a day out  overall an excellent stay i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris and looking to have a standout boutique hotel experiencei was stuck in paris as there was a rail strike and needed a nice place to sit and wait until i was picked up i was looked after immediately upon walking through the door celia was an absolute star the lounge area is to the right of the reception and is cool contemporary and elegant i had the house wine which at 18 euros a bottle was well priced i also had the meat and cheese board for 15 euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over really generous the staff could not have been more friendly they were both fantastic i forget the other guys name but he was amazing too it was so lovely that i returned on the following thursday on the way back to orly and had a few coffees there i adore this hotel and will absolutely be back as soon as im able tothis hotel had everything that you might expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service helpfulness and atmosphere at the hotel   the place felt like a home away from home with the welcime drink on offer and the boardgames the music was perfect and promoted a wonderfully relaxed ambience i would definitely come againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a bit far from centre of paris  room a bit too dark  no refrigerator is the room  bathroom does not have proper extractor in the ceiling price is fine thoughplace ditalie is great spot for good asian restaurants but with the metro only a couple of minutes to the center of paris  the interior is great especially the choice of colours we had the deluxe room with an antique bath very cool i recommend this hotel try the soft boiled bio egg in the morningthe hotel is beautiful and perfectly clean the rooms are gorgeous and the bathroom is a real pleasure  the breakfast is delicious and the staff is really nice helpful and friendly a really great place to stay in paris this is a very nice hotel with modern interior design and attentive staff breakfast was great and the common spaces were comfortable however the room was too small it was difficult cu walk around the bedone of the best hotels ive stayed at the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and quiet the staff were all friendly a metro station is close

owned by 2 sugar heirswhose designers had a clever concept   community of quality [coq  rooster]  highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners new upscale venture    i am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best  staff turnover has been significant an reallocated and it shows  the mascot pet silky chickens are dead 1 or rehomed 3  the flea market decor remains but the cool clientele is vanishing  the community of quality concept exists largely in merchandising and graphics  during the week photo and film shoots often  leave guests with nowhere to sit at weekend breakfast you can struggle tole coq hotel is located in the 13th district of paris an up and coming neighborhood just steps away from the place ditalie metro station from which you can easily access all the top sites in paris  the hotel lobby has a chic modern decor with velvet sofas cool artworks and interesting coffee table books giving it the air of a stylish cocktail bar theres even a sitting area full of plants and glass skylights which feels like a parisian glass menagerie and sitting room around a cozy fireplace breakfast is a sumptuous spread of fresh baguettes croissants configures fruit yogurt cheeses and meats served in the airy dining room at the front of the lobby the hotel has an elevator which for those of us me included that cant seem to leave home without a giantwe throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy spot close to the 5  6 train if you are comfortable using the metro we are new yorkers then this is the hotel for you about a 1015 minute train ride to all the major attractions and very easy to transfer to the airport bound trains we loved the design of the hotel very chic very clean and super friendly staff i left my adapter at home and they were kind enough to let me borrow one you saved me from an awful hair day thank you they also do a complimentary glass of wine from 6pm8pm and have a coffee station that you can use anytime of day stay here you wont regret itfantastic hotel uber cool furnishings and vibe  location not as central but certainly worth the extra journey time to enjoy it staff were welcoming and friendly breakfast and drinks were superb enjoyed the experience',\n",
              " 'room was very clean  transportation is very near i am very satisfied for good behaviour of hotel campanile stuffthey are very helpful  all time smiling face when i go paris definitely i booked campanile hotelone more think not in the list i special thanks to axelhotel campanile stuffthis hotel turned out to be perfect for our short stay staff were friendly and helpful the room was small but clean and contained all that we needed walking into the centre of paris was doable but if you are not up for this the metro is nearby the tour montparnasse provides a navigation point for wherever you go and is not far away above all i cannot fault the price which was very reasonable we did not try the breakfasts preferring to use one of the many local cafespros nice hotel very clean rooms has an elevator we got it for a very good price around 80 per night in feb for 2 people so just over 40 per person at the price we got it it was the best deal in paris for us other places that were cheaper were in worse locations  i like the location its not super central but the average time to most destinations is around 1525 minutes which is great it is also quite safe as far as we know and we never got any bad vibes when walking from the metro at night 2 girls alone i would not hesitate to stay in this hotelarea if i was traveling alone in fact the area seems even safer than some central parts aroundnorth of the louvre  we did not have to wait too long for elevator which is great in paris usually buildings have asecond time at this hotel  this time opted for double room for single occupancy to get a bit more room minimal provision but all perfectly acceptable and  keen price breakfast predictable but fineall was well in place clean and tidy  we were informed thatfor security reasons and  after working hours someone would open the front door  they failed to mention that the staff on duty had other duties calling him away from his desk  this resulted in us and other clients to wait outside for 15 whole minutes  lucky for us it was neither cold nor rainingeasy to get to from cdg airport and only a 5 minute walk from denfertrochereau station metro service

outside for 15 whole minutes  lucky for us it was neither cold nor rainingthis hotel is situated only a 10 min walk from the main montpanesse metro station and is therefore convenient for all attractions the hotel advertises a bar however in reality this appears to be a few drinks behind the reception desk however the staff are pleasant and friendly and speak english the rooms are however small along with the bathrooms which have a toilet shower and i believe some have baths i understand the bathrooms are currently being upgraded the hotel does serve breakfast french style and not what you would expect at an english or us hotel and is expensive at about 10 each due to the small room sizes the beds are small however i am 6ft 2 tall 188cmand and managed without too much effort to stretch out on the bed which my wife and i found verycampanile montparnasse has a really good location near to montparnasse station and metro lines room was small but very clean bed was so comfortable and space enough breakfast was nothing special but tasty good value for moneyhad a good experience staying in this hotel for 3 nights with my boyfriend had no problems here at all checkin and checkout was very easy and the rooms very nice and spacious it was in a good location too with plenty of places to get foodlocated a short walk from montparnasse tgv station the campanile is an ideal place for an overnight stay in paris connections to the rer metro and sncf network make it very easy to travel to and around paris small rooms with compact shower rooms and limited storage mean it doesnt suit a longer stay there is a small breakfast area with tiny outdoor patio serving a good basic buffet breakfastwe stayed in this hotel for 2 nights the room was bigger than expected and fairly modern the people on the front desk were very helpful close enough to a few metro stations 10min walk to get you around to the popular tourist attractions we then checked out and checked back in with our topdeck tour and got a completely different and much smaller room good wifi nice breakfast and a neat and tidy hotelnot really a short walk from gare montparnasse especially in 33degrees but hotel is smart and clean with helpful desk staff room was compact and for the bathroom you needed to be a bit of a contortionist but all the fittings were new and clean shower was good and powerful and towels were effective  breakfast was typically french and seating is a bit of a squeeze but all in all a perfectly acceptable hotel for a few nightsan easy 20 minute walk from the station pulling suitcases very clean comfortable room without the noise from other rooms that other reviewers experienced and we went from here gare montparnasse to versailles chantiers without having to transfer an excellent hotel location for visiting versailleseasy to get to from cdg airport and only a 5 minute walk from denfertrochereau station metro service around paris is also excellent from this location and there are plenty of cafes bars and shops nearby room was small but perfectly adequate for our 3 night stay cleanliness of the room was 1st class and breakfast was very decent too all in all for what we paid my wife and i were pleased would recommend for travellers on a smaller budget who are just want somewhere to sleep for a few nightsgood breakfast is served here although the dining area is quite small so it can be a bit of a challenge dancing with your tray getting through tables staff are really nice however we were constantly asked to show our room keys before heading to the elevator basically annoying for guests but a plus for security so cant complain much accommodation is sort of central depending on your interests in paris the walls are very thin its annoying trying to go to sleep with all the noise that was going on in the next room i was staying on level 5  morning  night they kept the hallway lights off which i thought was strange like what if theres an emergency  i cant see where im going dont think id stay here again but all in all this place is pretty good2 night stay in december 2018 booked as part of a top deck tour its a very good midrange hotel option in paris the room we had was quite spacious with a comfortable bed breakfast was also very good with a number of options including pancakes as well as the standard fare of a continental breakfast no real complaints  it is slightly out of the way from the centre of paris youll need to use line 13 from gat to champslyses  clemenceau and possibly transfer to line 1 get into the city it is easy enough but something worth noting that you will not have views of the eiffel tower etc from this hotelwe stayed here for a new year sight seeing trip we had a triple room which was three single beds two of which were pushed together all had a warm duvet and two pillows a small table in the corner a wardrobe a tv on the wall with local channels although we did find cnn international for news in english we had aircon and a powerful radiator in the bathroom which was a really big wet room fantastic shower however we did have to be a little bit careful not to soak the whole bathroom floor and steam up the mirrors staff all spoke good english and were extremely helpful we booked tickets online the day before for disneyland and reception were brilliant printing them out for us a 10 continental breakfast was available but we chose to get out and see paris the location is great awe stayed here for a total of two nights the staff were very pleasant and extremely helpful the only problem with the hotel is that it is not very central however it is close to a metro station it takes 20 minutes to get to where you want to go by metro the rooms were clean however it was cramped with the suitcases in there was no place to move around if there are 3 people sharing even if it is a child i would not recommend if youre heavy on luggage i would not recommend   the bathroom was tiny the shower cabinet was so small i felt claustrophobic staying in there longer than a minute theres no room to move your hands   there are places to eat around the hotel including bakeries and restaurants if you want to stay in you wont have a problem   for moregood hotel good experience no issues clean room and comfortable to sleep in bed is clean staff are friendly very spacious or was enough for me anyway i stayed with my tour group here enjoyable staywe stayed here 2 nights before heading off on bike trip the neighborhood is lovely and its close to the gaite metro stop the front desk staff were very kind and helpful allowed us to check in early room small but typical euro style bathroom was unusually large which was great and modern  breakfast was typical european continental style no eggs but some other protein choices yogurts cheese meat it served its purpose perfectly did not award 5 stars because my back is aching from the very hard bed  but some may love that also the street noise from outdoors is significant even with windows closed but otherwise a lovely stay in paris in a wonderful hotelgood location close to metro and bus very poor breakfast do not take it room was small but clean modern bathroom stuff helpful at ground floor no view at all bedding and towels changed daily i would recommend it just no breakfastaccommodation is comfortable although rooms are small it is removed from central paris so be prepared to commute in breakfast is nothing to write home about rather getting food while exploring the citystayed here 2 nights as a part of a group tour very crowded as other tours also stayed here  short walk to city centre room was dirty  blood on door and blanket breakfast was available not the greatest but surpassablevery clean rooms bedding changed daily safe box tea  coffee available updated bathroom fresh towels daily and gallons of hot water good value for what we paid bus stop is a short walk and metro also nearby we walked to all the attractions as we love a good walk we did not have the breakfast so we cannot comment on this staff on reception were very helpfulthe hotel it is perfect for those who are in paris to explore as this room has what you need a bed a tv storage space and a bathroom we had a room at the back so although there was not anything spectacular to look at it was actually quite nice as there are pretty little apartments and cobble paths connecting the streets  i cannot make any comment on the breakfast as we did not want to spend 10 euros each day so we bought things from the shop down the road although it did look nice and fresh  travel we flew in to charles de gaulle airport and followed the airport signs to the trains the signs are in english and are very clear so dont panic  metrotrains we went to an information desk red desk in the airport and the gentleman was really helpful he gave us aroom was nice clean and quite spacious for paris ive got no complaints about the room although the walls are very very thin i could clearly hear every moan sound this woman was making in the room next to us haha it was funny but i was abit annoyed when your tryna get some sleep hotel is not central but there is public transport everywhere breakfast was ok id skip breakfast and go out as there are so many great cafes and shops around the area i wouldnt stay here again but it was a good hotel based on the room and hotel facilities',\n",

giving us tips and  directions whenever neededwe could not have been happier with our stay at cler hotel we had excellent service from elsa who provided the most complete and delicious breakfast service daily and the receptionist sujit and all the others who worked at the reception rue cler was particularly quiet and many restaurants in the area closed the last part of august when we visited but we did like le roussillon next to the hotel and le recruetement two lively parisian bistros and bars when so many restaurants were closed for august vacations hotel rooms small but only compared to american standards just right for paris and a great elevator thank you for a wonderful stay the donovans hope to come back and practice more french with you  it was very nice that sujit offered to hold our luggage betweenhotel was small and quaint has an elevator and dinning place during breakfast clean and quiet if you open your windows you can hear the outside noise of the street market but

expensive for what it is but its nice enough if youre in paris there is a lot of eating to be done anyhow i would absolutely stay at this hotel againmy wife and i stayed there for our first trip to paris and we would both highly recommend this hotel very modest in amenities but great location and very friendly staff idir front desk staff was awesome giving us tips and  directions whenever

but was not loud i would stay here againhotel was small and quaint has an elevator and dinning place during breakfast clean and quiet if you open your windows you can hear the outside noise of the street market but when closed you dont hear anything having the street market literally outside of your hotel is a blessing you can walk to a bakery souvenir shop restaurants and many many more thingswe spent 2 nights in this small but uptodate hotel recently renovated in a pedestrian area close with a general daily market and many interesting shops it is also close to a couple of metro station line 8 walking distance from tour eiffel and les invalides we will choose this hotel again for our next trip to parisnewly renovated chic little hotel in a perfect location   pedestrian street in the center of the paris   the service and the team there made us feel welcome  love the shower the views the bedding and the ambiancestayed at the cler hotel from dec 28th through jan 1st  i want to thank all the staff especially florentin who helped us secure transportation during the strikes this past december   the view from our room of the eiffel tower was memorable plus   the restaurants the market and shops like the chocolate one on the street made it a great place to stay   its about 10 mins walk from the eiffel tower   rooms are small bathroom was still decent size   the elevator fits two people only or one person with their bagif all you care about is location and cleanliness this place will do the job  but other than that we werent so impressed  we stayed in another hotel in paris near the train station whistler and it was a better hotel not counting the location  you cant beat the location on rue cler with lots of restaurantsshops just meters away and walkability to the eiffel tower  theres a supermarket nearby and the metro stop is not far either    as for the bad tiny room with not much in the way of furniture besides the bed  hard to find a place to put things  tiny claustrophobic elevator and narrow stairs  no freebies they have drinkssnacks available in the kitchen but they are all overpriced  one day they forgot  to restock our room with anything we didnt havethe cler hotel was located on a popular street rue cler with many restaurants and shops the location is great just a 10 minute walk to the eiffel tower we stayed in room 605 and we could see the eiffel tower from our bed and bathroom so cool the room was clean and the bathroom had a rain shower the staff were all very friendly and helpful with answering any questions we had during our stay there is an option to pay for breakfast but we didnt because there are many cute restaurants on the street that serve breakfast would highly recommend this hotel great location friendly staff clean roomswe had a nonrefundable stay scheduled in midmay at the tail end of a 2 week trip  i contacted the hotel to request the amount paid be applied as a credit when we reschedule the trip  the hotel went a step further and refunded the amount for our stay  this trip will be rescheduled and cler hotel will definitely be includedi stayed at the cler hotel for a week in the month of november 2019 for a business trip it isnt a business hotel but then i was ok to be not provided such a business hotel feeling since this hotel was acknowledged greatly for their hospitality which is more important to me as against  i had my wife join me in the middle of the week so that i can use the later part of the trip for leisure visiting in and around paris i went for this hotel predominantly because of  the eiffel tower view and another its proximity to some of the best places around  around the hotel i was overwhelmed when i laid my at the street for the first time  rue cler where this hotel is based it is a bright and colorful street to make your day filled with flowers fruits and eateries  one canmy daughter  i recently stayed here for 3 nights in march 2020 we were absolutely satisfied with this hotel first of all this is a great location if this is the area you want to be in near the eiffel tower it is a lovely boutique hotel with the small elevator  winding steps up to the  reception area we had a room with a view of the eiffel tower which was amazing i could lay in bed and watch the eiffel tower sparkle at night sure the room is not that big but those who complain must not travel in europe often because rooms are not that big the shower was simply wonderful because of the overhead rain showerhead plus we even had a view of the eiffel tower from our bathroom so we loved our room on the 6th floor  secondly the service at the front desk was fabulousperfect hotel with a really nice location near the tower staff is very friendly mearsures about covid19 was perfect everything is really clean a lot of restaurants in de street near the bus and metro with 1 stopover from gare du nord untill the hotel it was like maybe 20 minutes everything was perfect and i really like to come backgreat stay luxurious room excellent location and staff  just a short walk from the eiffel tower with views from the room this is an excellent location for a special occasion or just to visit paris  will be coming backwe stayed at the cler hotel for 3 nights during a long weekend trip to paris the hotel is right on charming rue cler which has plenty of bakeries and restaurants and is less than a 10 minute walk to the eiffel tower rooms are on the smaller side typical for paris but are clean and modern the hotel staff is very friendly warm and helpful with tips for traveling around paris highly recommendedlovely boutique hotel set in cobbled streets full of cafes cheese shops restaurants chocolate shops and bakerys  only a few streets from the effie tower the hotel is super clean and the staff couldnt be any friendlier and helpfuldue to the covid situation they do not make the room or change the towels during your stay this i did not like this information does not appear on the website when booking new hotel with small rooms located on a very lively street all day and night because there is a fruit market noise is heard at dawn when the market is set up the tiny elevator can only accommodate one person close to the metro exit and the eiffel towerone of the best places to stay at when visiting paris this was my third time in paris and without a doubt the best experience hotel wise the staff is nice and helpful the rooms are cosy and overall give you a feeling of being welcome in the city']"

another hotel that sent our booking to the hotel passy eiffel as a result of not reopening as planned   got all that  the change of booking proved to be a great one at that as our original hotel was a 2 and the hotel passy eiffel is a 3  the hotel is wellsituated with a view of the eiffel tower  we landed in paris on july 24 bastille day and enjoyed the best fireworks show ever from our window  truth be known there was a little leaning out of  the window involved  there is a great pastry shop a few doors down the source for  morning croissants and coffee which we would bring back to the hotel and enjoy in a small and verywe had a room for 3 it was very roomy to be a paris room the bathroom as well all clean and nice from our french balcony we could see the eiffel tour the front desk was helpful breakfast was boring french only baguette and croissant with coffee and juice the breakfast staff did not speak any english  the hotel is in a nice neighborhood with some restaurants close by and a lot of shops closest metro station passy was closed during our stay but it is not a long walk to trocaderothe hotel was great and the stuff was extremely pleasant and took very good care of

worth every penny  the service was top notch very helpful staff great location at very reasonable prices  thank you for a wonderful stayvery practical location in the centre of paris my room was a good size and very clean the hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive a couple of areas for improvement the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads it just brought down the whole room as did the freestanding cupboard when all the furnishing was so nice this looked a bit like a super cheap unit painted which stuck out a bit lastly although i was on the 6th floor at 630am i could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the roomsour group had a lovely stay at the hotel relais bosquet in paris  the location was perfect with respect to ease of access to buses and the metro  getting around was simple and safe  the rooms were small but clean the breakfast was a good value and the staff was helpful  our only complaints would be that the carpets and linens could stand refreshingi stayed 6 nights and couldnt have been happier with this

you anywhere in paris to see the sights or hop on the train to versailles or long distance travel reception gave me clear written directions from the train station which metro to take to etolle

recently stayed at hotel grand powers for 5 nights and i cannot wait to return the hotel is beautiful and my room was the nicest ive ever stayed in paris with a balcony and a view of the eiffel tower and the spa amenities were very relaxing the staff was so kind and welcoming especially the concierges they made me feel special every day the location was central to everything  i walked everywhere i cannot recommend the hotel enough  i will be sure to stay here again next time i visit mercii lived every single moment while staying at the grand powers starting wonderful and fast check in with complimentary champagne the room was exactly like i imagine typical luxurious parisian  apartment  modernart deco design with classic  empire  french spirit  definitely  the best boutique hotel in the most luxurious neighborhood of paris  cant wait to come back ps ask for 5th floor for the best viewi hate to write this review i stopped reviewing in ta a few years ago in protest  as it provided no incentive to continue unfortunately the entire experience here was so exceptional it would be unjust not to give credit for the exceptional service and experience we had there from the moment we entered the staff welcomed us by name  if we had a request it was addressed immediately without hesitation the room was spacious charming and immaculate with the view of the eiffel tower as promised the location is wonderfully adorned with the best shopping brands in the world good restaurants and sites paris is famous for a wonderful complimentary bottle of wine was brought to  our room for no reason  and greatly appreciated i cant say enough of the outstanding entirethe hotel is very well situated just near champselysees and metro stations upon arrival i was told that i was upgraded to junior suite i booked a deluxe room which was a very pleasant surprise the room was beautiful and clean the street in front of the hotel is a bit noisy which can be disturbing for a sensitive ear i always travel with my ear plugs so it wasnt a problem for me to sleep  the staff both at the front desk and at the restaurant are very friendly and it was a pleasure talking with them  i also had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and everything was fresh and delicious you can also have almond  oat milk for coffee and glutenfree bread which is great as this isnt an option in many places all in one i will definitely return to this hotel for mymy wife and i were very pleased with our stay at the hotel grand powers we have stayed at numerous hotels during our visits to the city and we agree that enjoyed our experience at the hotel the best thus far the comfort and the beauty of the room were great but it was the attention professionalism and courtesy of the staff that made it an exceptional experience for usi spent a lot of time researching hotels in paris and after switching from fauchon last minute i made the change to grand power purely for its location and reviews  ill start by saying im very glad i chose this hotel and it is justifiably high on tripadvisor having been on a 3 week trip around france and in many larger luxury properties this smaller boutique hotel was a welcome change and offers a much more personal refined service that is more difficult to achieve in larger establishments  check in was very warm and welcoming i found gonzalo very charming and authentic and he remained so very helpful and attentive throughout my stay regularly checking up on me the room was slightly delayed at check in but gonzalo insisted on more welcome drinks for me and was veryexcellent hotel great staff rooms perfect they let us shower in extra room after arriving from usa and our room was not ready free champagne at desk great breakfast beds perfect perfect location steps from arc de triomphe concierge helpful id stay here againthis is the best hotel ive stayed in paris the hotel grand power is ideally situated in the hearth of paris the breakfast is amazing staff is friendly and professional   i definitely recommend 55we spent a great 3day stay with my wife in this hotel we particularly appreciated the design the environment and the people of this place  smaller than the hotels we visited before the service was more personalized and attentive the bedrooms are fully equipped with an amazing view i highly recommend this hotel to enjoy great time in paris in a super nice and easy wayour hotel when in paris thats it we honestly feel like home when we visit  beautiful and typical parisian building just big enough so you still have the personal touch  from warm welcome on arrival to efficient departure everything is perfect  tried  several different rooms basic to more exclusive and they are all superbly newly decorated bright well

            "Paragraph:    we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing very pricey area though so be prepared to spend 100 on a meal in the evening for two hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win friendly staff at reception room was very small however for a short city break for 2 this was just fine price was no different from 3 nights at a premier inn in the uk would recommendi highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozawe chose this hotel due to its excellent location  right next to the trocadero and short walks to the tour eiffel and arc de triomphe it is well positioned for a short city break  30mins from gard du nord on the metro  the facilities provided were good  clean room comfy bed ensuite  i was surprised though at what was not included in the room wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent locationperfect location perfect friendly personal parking lot to reserve nearby good continental breakfast clean nice and good restaurant in neighborhood location also in very nice neighborhood tres bienthe hotel is near the trocadero place one of the best place to see the eiffel tower near the chaillot palace near also le muse des monuments franais le muse de la marine  its very well locatedwe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the teamwe were forced to cancel our trip due to the pandemic and hotel longchamp was the only accommodation that would not work with us on obtaining a refund or even letting us change our dates to one year later they did offer us to pay a change fee to change our dates a few months later but didnt offer this until less then one week before our planned stay which was too late to coordinate with the rest of our already rescheduled trip hotel longchamp had ignored all communication with us when trying to deal with this in a timely manner our experiences with all our other various flight and hotel reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasoni highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was

hotel for 2 nights on holiday on arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great the hotel room was a great size bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy we were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly as we didnt know paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed would highly recommend staying herewe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the

a review since we are so happy with this hotel it really lived up to the expectations that we had it is just as fresh as in the pictures friendly staff and central location recommend itmy stay in the hotel was unforgettable the rooms are very private and clean the bathroom is very neat as well the staff was friendly and welcoming makes me feel like home is near to trocadero so you can go a enjoy the view of the beautiful eiffel towerclean rooms friendly staff really feels like home  breakfast is nice everything is fresh and delicious  reception is at your service 247 and that is great  one disadvantage  you can hear the noise in the hall while being in your roomi have chosen this hotel several times and will certainly stay there again it has an excellent location both for touristic and business trips the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel staff is very attentive and helpfulhotel is in a great location staff was pleasant and helpful rooms are very tight standard double end bed was literally less than a foot from the wall no floor space to open your bags carpet in room and stairwell is kinda old dark and not clean looking stairwells seemed darkrecently stayed here with my family i have a young baby and was still made to feel welcome which has been a problem when travelling previously  great location nice clean hotel i would definitely recommendmy family stayed in a triple room 2 adults 1 child at this lovely little hotel and loved it  the location could not be beat it was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the eiffel tower the hotel staff was so kind and nice the breakfast each morning was very tasty and the room was a good size for our family when we return to paris we will definitely stay here againthe area was good for restaurants and close to metro station the problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible not even the entry was accessible there were stairs and a smaller than average doorways the bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 13 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door the biggest problem was that the room was too small i know that paris has small rooms but this was like a closet i am not exaggerating there was also construction so ask if there still is any as it was very loudvery nice staff shout out to edris and brightaquad room was nice 4 sistersfirst time in parisand clean location couldnt be betterwalking distance to the eiffel tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metrotrainhighly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit parislocation 1010 the administration 1010 we were absolutely happy in this hotel hope to come back here again and again  i dont know what else to say so im writing something to tripadviser   good bey see u soonmyself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to paris on easter weekend we experienced the wonderful paris friday traffic jams lol when we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick he gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as i had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot i certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes  restaurant are just amazing thank you hotel longchamp elyseesi first stayed here in 1984 and when it came time to visit again with my wife we did so this spring  the hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night  it is close to two metro lines and within walking distance to the bois de bologne champs elysees eiffel tower trocodero museums and more and there are many good restaurants bistros chinese sushi portuguese patisseries the accommodations are first rate and the amenities are superior  looking forward to visiting again and soonmy husband and i stayed here for our ruby wedding anniversary and it is a fab hotel centrally situated near the eiffel tower and just a short walk from larc de triomphe metro station just a few minutes walk from hotel the staff here are so nice and really helpful we would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to paris bernie  patsywe had a great four night stay at hotel longchamp elysees the staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived arriving on a saturday we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid the rooms were on the smaller size  to be expected but were clean and well kept planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night the location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day would certainly recommendnice hotel in paris france near the eiffel tower  great staff very helpful  room was small but comfortable and safe  no refrigerator in the room but europe doesnt usually provide refrigerators in rooms anyway  very small hotel but near many cafes metro and sightseeing  best hotel we stayed in during our tripi generally do not write poor reviews however i would not stay here again at all no lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos no offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents walls paper thin i could here kids yelling at all hours the ac is not controlled by you in your room the door key had to be left with front desk for the day its 2019 invest in proper doors locks the male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude  camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses  the food for breakfast what food eggs not cooked 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc disappointing decent location the eiffel tower was close and that is the best i can say for thislong champs elysees hotel is great exceeded my expectations few walks to restaurants grocery stores and to eiffel where it is great to see at night breakfast is great chooses are many hotel size is good bathroom is really spacious  hotel has mini english garden to smoke eat has concierge service that keeps your belongings safely hotel is clean  quiet   certainly will recommend to friends and family \n",

            "Paragraph:    very nice hotel good price for its location a lot of attractions close by such as sacre coeur opera galleries lafayette etc we have walked once to the eiffel tower but its a good hour walking otherwise we used uber all the time works well the hotel is very cosy rooms are small but i would say its ideal for the ones who are visiting the city breakfast was good but there is also other places aroundloved this place cozy romantic and near to everything there is a metro station just around the corner as well lots of cafes and lots to do just around the corner the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you i recommend this place highlygreat location very good breakfast but when you ask for the internet they say that the only one is orange which obviously is insecure slow and basically does not work it is unacceptable that they don t give you a proper connection when there is a brittany one i won t return i have never lived something like thisvery clean hotel that is well located good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby bar wasnt open at any time and a paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge it was only when paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid forstayed for 3 nights last week check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout our room was a fairly small but typical of paris hotels a comfy bed and well decorated a clean bathroom and good warm working shower the location is excellent not far from gare du nord main train station the neighborhood is brilliant lots of coffee shops and eateries within walking distance montmartrepigalle area approx 15 mins and sacre cour cathedrale 2025 mins awayhubs and i stayed here for 4 nights in a non smoking room on 1st floor at far end from main stairs pleasant stay clean and comfortable room ac works well bathroom is good size clean and working in good condition staff are cheerful and friendly we will definitely stay here again for next triproom was a little more spacious than the typically smaller hotel rooms on paris and has air conditioning although at the time of our visit not working at its best front desk was able to give us a fan and that made a big difference   comfy bed wonderful soaker tub and windows that spill out into the courtyard  quiet   literally walk out the door and you are have cafes and shops waiting for you  only a few minutes walk to galeries lafayette and its breathtaking stain glassed ceiling   friendly staff great location and comfortable roomsthe location is very parisien  the neighborhood offering a wide range of specialities gourmet cafeteria restaurants for one person the public transportation is ok i came by roissybus from ch de gaule airport 12 euros one stop at opra  the first night room was clean and nice view on the street but very noisy and cold because the windows are not closing properly if this issue will be settled the room is ok the air conditioning is not working in cold season so the only heating source was the bathroom heater keeping the bathroom door open the second night i change the room with a bigger and soundproofed one but dark and sad  the backyard with walls here no heating at all on my request they provide a mobile air flow device i cant used it during the nightthe staff are warm and welcoming and eager to help the rooms are on the small side but adequate for a short stay we had a room with a magnificent view of the sacre couer all lit up at night there are bars and restaurants nearby that offer a variety of different cuisines and range from the inexpensive to mid top endwe stayed here for 3 nights and it was adequate but id spend a few  more and find something better  upon arrival we checked in and the guy on reception wasnt that friendly he barely lifted his head to talk to us he gave up our room number and key and that was it we werent given any directions to our room and after a minute had to ask where was the lift and what floor were we on before he could be bothered to tell us  omg the lift is tiny 2 adults and 2 small suitcases at a max so we just used the stairs after that the room was ok but the shower was broken and you had to stand in it holding the shower  above your head which apparently is ok when we complained to the woman at reception next day and every morning we complained about the shower been broken but thestayed here for three night over new year  booked a standard double which was bard on the 4th floor the room are on the small side but clean bathroom is adequate there are tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to leave reminders so room service would leave replacements the hotel is in a superb location for the notredame lorette metro and all the main shopping areas fare du nord is a 15 minute walk and if youre fit enough 20 minutes from the sacrecoure lots of bars and fabulous bistros nearbypro  nice rooms  location 2 metro lines and buses in close vicinity many restaurantsbars couple of minutes to montmartre 30 min by foot to the louvre  concierge at checkin was lovely  5th floor rooms have minibalconys more like french windows  normal hand shower  overhead shower  modern rooms trendy bar on the bottom floor  con  power outlets and light switches are illuminated whatever for and that makes the room much to bright to sleep comfortably  bed tiny for 2 people  pillows lumpy  uncomfortable  thin walls could hear people in neighbouring room enjoying themselves  concierge couldnt tell us where to get stamps  breakfast was a bit poor for the price  staff overseeing the breakfast buffet was kinda creepy and weird  room was not reallyi only stayed here for one quick night before leaving paris i found my room neat enough though on the first floor i was subjected to the street noises that naturally occur in a large city the room was clean if a bit frayed at the edges the staff was very friendly and spoke good englishmy wife and i decided to travel europe to celebrate our birthdays  first stop paris we  picked hotel brittany due to its location specifically to moulin rouge but also its proximity to many attractions and a reasonable price  upon arrival we were slightly disappointed tired after a ten hour flight we needed a quick nap and shower  the room was very small and had some watermarking discoloration on the ceiling and no view despite asking for a decent room upon check in  i let the manager know that i had some issues with the room and that it was not exactly what we had in mind for our four days in paris  we were given a reasonable upgrade that really made the difference in our stay  the staff were helpful and the hotel was really quite charming the location was perfect forthis was my second stay at this hotel and again it didnt disappoint friendly helpful staff nice and clean very central to a lot of attractions all within walking distance a metro station just around the corner for those longer trips  i will definitely be back againme and my friend stayed here for a short break for 4 nights the hotel itself was beautifully kept very nice and helpful staff who always had a smile on their faces  the only downside to the hotel itself is that there isnt anywhere to get a coffee apart from at breakfast and when we asked for milk they said they only had cream  as we were leaving our bathroom seemed to have acquired a number of ants not to sure where they were coming from i wouldve mentioned it but we had to check out  the eiffel tower notre damn champslyses and the main marathon is approximately 30 mins to 1 hour away by walking depending on if you stop to take in the sights   all in all a lovely little boutique guest house with lots of character friendly staff and quirky bits i wouldit was a pure pleasure to spent a weeekend in this charming hotel located in lovely neighbourhood close to bars cafes and restaurants walking distance to city centre and main attractions you wont be disappointed with superb customer service and lovely fresh tasty brrakfast i am sure you will fall in love with main restaurant and bar area where you can grab a glass of wine or cocktail on afternoon thank you for lovely stay and i look forward to back here again very sooni choose the brittany hotel because i remembered it from my first time in paris 30 years ago  that is true  naturally things change but when i looked it up and saw that it was still in existence read the reviews and saw the rate i booked it  i am very happy that i did  the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the notre dame de lorette metro stop in a nontouristy area of paris  if you want to exit your hotel and be among all the tourists and the most popular sights this might not be for you  but if youre like me and you want to walk the streets and feel as though you are in a real parisian neighborhood i would highly recommend it  it is a very short walk to the opera and the stores on blvd haussmann and a slightly longer but still reasonable walk up to montmartre  theno complaints the entire staff was very friendly and they were all bi or multi lingual i stayed in a cozy room so it was small but i wasnt in it very much the lift is tiny capacity three people but its not the end of the world if you have to let one person go up and wait for it to come back down  wifi worked fine was a little slow once or twice but nothing significant  bus and metro options are very nearby and its within walking distance of montmartre and three of the major train stations paris has a fantastic public transportation app so its really easy to catch a bus or the metro to the city center like around the eiffel tower theres a bakery right around the corner and lots of restaurants nearby as well  their early booking discount was phenomenal when ibooked 7 weeks prior for a 4 night stay was told on check in would have to move after 2 nights due to planned work surely should have planned the bookings better but as there was noisy work going on in the room above thought it would be better to move until we realised we were immediately below our original room so had noise again   the hotel is in a great area and we would stay in this area again the final straw was out airport taxi which we booked on day 2 reminded reception on day 3 and the final night only to be told half an hour before we were due to leave they nothing had been booked the very unhelpful man on reception just told us to try uber ourselves as everyone was on strike after checking the metro was running which it was but 5 changes with 4 casesthis hotel is very central in paris easy walking distance to the sacred heart cathedral positives the rooms are large for what you would expect in central paris and very clean the staff are friendly and helpful  neutral the elevator may be the smallest i have ever seen which i actually enjoyed but others with claustrophobic tendencies may find distressing  negative mild my rooms toilet leaked slowly which meant there was a trickling sound all night the room was slightly too dark as

distance of the gare du nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are

this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in

definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central

beautiful decorative details the hotel is quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water

such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great breakfast \n",

            "Paragraph:    my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station and just steps from the bastille round about our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants we ate at le coq rico in the monmartre a la biche au bois two blocks away au temps des cerises just on the marais border and les coquettes de christian constant close to eiffel all of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices the room at pavillon bastille had a small coolerand available coffee and teathere is a large grocery about 1 12 blocks toward the train stationthe entire hotel was clean and well taken care of breakfast in the basement was also very goodvery reasonably priced hotel that is wellkept booked directly on site and received free breakfast cant complain about the bedroom and bathroom  comfortable and clean  its located very close to bastille station 5 minute walk and possibly a 15 minute walk to gare de lyon if you are driving it is conveniently located in front of opera house parking stationthis hotel was a nice surprise after having spent many nights in noisy andor uncomfortable paris hotels a small place just off the place de la bastille and lots of activity the hotel is surprisingly quiet with low internal traffic ie hallway chatter the rooms come with whatever you need from a clothesline in the bath to a minibar the staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like from an espresso to a big cup of classic coffee i will certainly return mercithe best bit of this hotel is the staff  very friendly helpful especially since we arrived during a rail strike special thanks go to indural  who organised taxi transport back to cdg when the rotten sncf were on strike and there were no trains our room was in a perfect position  top floor at the end so noone next door to disturb us our room was also facing a side street so we had no traffic noise we did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away we had a good selection of tv programmes  cnn bbc world and a few french sports programmes the hotel is in an ideal place for metro bars restaurants and visiting the local area would stay there again in an instanta nice hotel in a typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit pariscant fault the location staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are clean with pleasant lighting the beds are as small as they come comfortable enough and it means a bit more floor space for the suitcases great to have a kettle in the room as well as coffee facilities in reception would stay againthe room was very nice and clean  however we had the desk call us a taxi on the morning of 1082021 and the driver charged us 421 to go to beauvais airport  we did expect to pay about 150 because of what we had researched but this was definitely wrong  i hope they dont continue  calling this taxi companyvery clean and tidy place is reasonably priced especially for the time of year tour de france good location where you can easily get to locations by half hour to fourth five minute walk or public transport 5 mins away beds are comfortable breakfast was average for a buffetif the prices were higher for this small chic hotel it would be called a boutique hotel but the news here is that it is everything that boutique hotels are but without the crazy prices   our double room was nicely decorated with a super comfortable bed and sleek bed covers and soft go to sleep pillows easy access wifi was a huge plus  as were the hefty towels in the bathroom which were lovely after a hot shower caveat  the hair dryer is a little strange so if thats important you might bring your own travel hair dryer    the staff speaks english and could not have been nicer when our flight was cancelled we called from the airport and the front desk was very accommodating about just giving us our same room   breakfast comes with the room  also a big plus  soeverything you would expect from a threestar hotel good central location being a couple of minutes from the metro station room clean and good size for paris hotel with comfortable bed and good quality linen excellent buffet breakfast with fresh croissant and pastries we will use this hotel againsmall cosy hotel just few steps from place de la bastille and metra line exit in font of lopera bastille the room size is typical for paris hotel but

station unfortunately we were here during the metro strikes so did not take advantage of it overall a very pleasant staywe spent 3 nights here on a recent visit to paris the hotel was easily accessed from the metro from our arrival point on the eurostar with only a short stroll from bastille metro stop the lady at reception when we arrived was warm and friendly and thankfully fluent in english as our french was very limited we found the room small but more than adequate for a couple who were there only to sleep the bed was very comfortable ensuring a restful sleep and the room cleaned daily with a safe in the room we felt confident that passports and credit cards were safely left there we did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this the price did however seem quite reasonable particularly when considering the cost of meals in paris it needs to be noted that thevery convenient place for stay in paris excellent access to any transport nice staff quiet rooms good start point to discover galeries historic buildings or follow the life in streets from typical cafswe had a very enjoyable couple of nights staying in this hotel the bed was very large and comfortable and the breakfast selection was brilliant it is very well located for visiting paris and would definitely recommendwatch out if you stay here as my sister and i had money stolen from a locked bag in our hotel room not a good start to our holiday   otherwise it is a fairly standard hotel in a good location close to the gare de lyonthe hotel has clean rooms a good and rich breakfast the rooms were a bit small but it was very clean he deserves his choice and because of his honor and because of his very good standing next to the undergroundme and my teenage daughter loved our stay at this hotel

ballet at opera bastillewe had a great experience staff of the hotel was friendly the rooms were clean and comfortable and the price was rightto top it off the hotel was on walking distance of the city centre at least for uswe had an overnighter here after finishing our 3 week cycle tour of southeastern france  the location was handy for getting cross town to gare du nord for our return leg  staff were friendly and couldnt really fault the room for a short stay  we might have been more forgiving due to our many nights under canvas on the bicycling tour   hotel has a useful side ramp for wheeled access to the lobby and a nice little gated outdoor area at the front   price was reasonable for paris and it was pretty much a standard type hotel  weve stayed in better and worse in our dozen or so visits to the cityfriendly nice little hotel clean budget about 100 eur per night are the first words coming to mind it is perfectly located at walking distance from bastille subway etc and also very close to the train station gare de lyon i walked there without problem  the room with 2 twin beds was spacious quiet thanks to good windows isolation a little noise from people passing through the corridor though with confortable bed simple but nice decoration and goodcreanfunctional bathroom the staff was very nice 24h   make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but more importantly they offer breakfast if you book with their site worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast the croissants were to die formy husband and i stayed in this hotel for 8 nights on the first leg of our trip to europe in  september of 2019  we thought the hotel was very nice yes the rooms were a bit small but we did not feel cramped at all we had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room  we were surprised how quiet the area was  and we had a room facing rue de lyon it was very close to the bastille metro stop from where you could get everywhere after 8 days of riding the metro all over in paris we became very familiar with the system  the room and bathroom were very clean the bed and pillows comfortable we had very restful nights after exploring paris  we did not get the breakfast  as we wanted to go out and explore options for breakfast so i can not comment on \n",

or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing

stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little

clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my home \n",

            "Paragraph:    stayed for 4 nights at lumieres monmartre and had a pleasant enjoyable experience staff are helpful and polite and speak english well  the rooms are modern very clean and cozy and there is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus right into the heart of paris loads of little eateries around and right across the road from a minimarket  highly recommended and i would absolutely stay there againnice clean modern

with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricehorrible most disgusting service i have ever encountered the night time attendant mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripwe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer

unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back \n",

to stay every time we come to parisstaff is outstanding i arrived at the hotel having lost all my id information in the airport  they called lost and found at the airport and registered my losts and looked up the address for the usa embassy  i do not speak french so they were so helpful when i needed a translation  this was my eighth stay at your hotel and it has always been a great experiencethe hotel was cute off of a corner street and the interior decorations were subtle but comforting they had the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in the room was much smaller than expected however but we made do the customer service was very friendly and accommodating the location is perfect surrounded by a plethora of restaurants a walk away from the tower and a short drive to all the main sites definitely staying again for my next trip to parisperfect location and a view of eiffel tower from room was a nice surprise lots of cafes and restaurants around check in check out very smooth and everyone was very nice breakfast was nice but if you are paying 13 each i would expect a little more selection overall we would definitely look at staying here the next time we go for a weekend thanks to everyonethe hotel located close to eiffel tower the place is very close and convenient to the center of the city of paris the staff are very friendly and helpful the hotel very clean and can help you to go to and from the airportwe enjoyed a wonderful and welcoming stay at the hotel relais bosquet paris  we requested the upgrade to the beautiful eiffel tower view at an extra charge and it was worth every penny  the service was top notch very helpful staff great location at very reasonable prices  thank you for a wonderful stayvery practical location in the centre of paris my room was a good size and very clean the hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive a couple of areas for improvement the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads it just brought down the whole room as did the freestanding cupboard when all the furnishing was so nice this looked a bit like a super cheap unit painted which stuck out a bit lastly although i was on the 6th floor at 630am i could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the roomsour group had a lovely stay at the hotel relais bosquet in paris  the location was perfect with respect to ease of access to buses and the metro  getting around was simple and safe  the rooms were small but clean the breakfast was a good value and the staff was helpful  our only complaints would be that the carpets and linens could stand refreshingi stayed 6 nights and couldnt have been happier with this boutique hotel the  reception staff was so pleasant and helpful in giving me directions everyday  on the metro or city map the location was fantastic with a short 2 blocks  to the metro which will get you anywhere in paris to see the sights or hop on the train to versailles or long distance travel reception gave me clear written directions from the train station which metro to take to etolle militaire stop to walk 2 blocks to the hotel   rue cler street with all the cafes and shops is just a 12 block away from the front door there is a market and bakery a couple of doors away a pharmacy 2 blocks away to get your covid test prior to your return flight to the us my upgraded room  53 was on the 5th floor with ait was a great experience since the moment of the check in people at front desk very friendly our room with very decent space very comfortable bed extremely clean the restroom experience was the best we have experience in europe big and super clean location is very convenient lots of cafes around the area it is worth the price strongly recommendednice large room and it was well appointed  the staff was very friendly and the location just 5 minutes from the eiffel tower could not be better  we will definitely stay here again when we come back to pariseverything about the stay was excellent friendly and helpful staff good breakfastgreat location and access to effiel towerrue cler room decent size recommend highly donh nashville tennessee usawhat a great find a multigenerational trip to france might have been daunting pandemic aside what a pleasure to find such a gem of a hotel perfectly located with the amazing front of house staff only too happy to offer advice or make arrangements for your stay while spoilt for accommodation options in paris you would be hardpressed to find such a great balance between price location and service definitely a property we would use again and again and againwe went to paris to celebrate a birthday like many reviewers have said the location is wonderful we walked rue cler daily lots of nice bakeries restaurants  stores chocolatiers etc we got a deluxe room with eiffel tower view the view was spectacular see pictures the breakfast was very good with many options the bed was very comfortable we had a room with a tubshower combination which was nice staff were very helpful traveling during covid was complicated hotel staff recommended a pharmacy that was both convenient in location and also offered a good price for their covid testing we did get eu covid passes one came prior to departure and the

that it is affordable \n",

            "the hotel is placed on a very beautiful street with a view of the eiffel tower the rooms are pleasant the reception works 247 which is crucial for us since we are walking till late night the cleaning services is amazing once a dayeverything was great the room the staff the food the location my favourite part was the fact we could see the eiffel tower from our room and it was only a 10min walk the staff are so nice and the breakfast is greatthe locations is very good close to the metro many shops along the street and nice restaurants clean rooms and newly furbished bathrooms windows are soundproof staff is nice and friendly only minus would be that breakfast is served at the table and every morning same choice but you can order more so it is big enough my room will need very soon a carpet to be renewed however rooms are quite big bigger than in many hotels in paris i would come back on my next trip to paristhe rooms were nice clean and quiet  the staff was wonderful

tall small places so i got my car parked at radio france new parking enough room en afforablei spent nights solo while on business in the area and i recommend the hotel passy eiffel without reservation if you are looking to stay in the 16th you cant beat this location easy walking distance to the tower and the seine for sure and not far to bois de boulogne the other direction also a very short walk to the metro for everything else rue de passy itself is lovely especially at night as it has overhead lights all the way along with many restaurants on close proximity the room i had was spacious enough clean and comfortable and with a reasonably priced minibar the courtyard view meant it was very quiet nice modern bathroom the breakfast is very nice served in a cute room off the main entrance breads and pastries fruit and yogurt cereals cheese and meatsthe rooms were nice clean and quiet  the staff was wonderful and even found a room for my mom where se was able to see the eiffel

rooms are clean eiffeltower is 10 min walk subway 5 min walk food and drinks less than a minute walk parking car is more a thing the nearby parking is very tall small places so i got my car parked at radio france new parking enough room en afforablei loved the idea of having a courtyard outside of my room it felt like i was in my own world and it was so beautiful and peaceful checking in was a breeze and the staff was super nice i would definitely stay againthe locations is very good close to the metro many shops along the street and nice restaurants clean rooms and newly furbished bathrooms windows are soundproof staff is nice and friendly only minus would be that breakfast is served at the table and every morning same choice but you can order more so it is big enough my room will need very soon a carpet to be renewed however rooms are quite big bigger than in many hotels in paris i would come back on my next trip to paristhe checkin was efficient the staff friendly and helpful the room clean there was special care with the soundproofing  it was on a busy street and my room was next to the stairs but it was very quietfrom our arrival to departure we were treated with care and courtesy by  the staff our luggage was taken to our room which was well appointed and the bed was most comfortable the hotel has a friendly atmosphere and rather elegant in its presentation and we would definitely recommend it and look forward to returning soonthe 4 of us 2 retired couples from the sonoma county ca wine country ended up at this hotel after 2 covid related rebookings with another hotel that sent our booking to the hotel passy eiffel as a result of not reopening as planned   got all that  the change of booking proved to be a great one at that as our original hotel was a 2 and the hotel passy eiffel is a 3  the hotel is wellsituated with a view of the eiffel tower  we landed in paris on july 24 bastille day and enjoyed the best fireworks show ever from our window  truth be known there was a little leaning out of  the window involved  there is a great pastry shop a few doors down the source for  morning croissants and coffee which we would bring back to the hotel and enjoy in a small and verywe had a room for 3 it was very roomy to be a paris room the bathroom as well all clean and nice from our french balcony we could see the eiffel tour the front desk was helpful breakfast was boring french only baguette and croissant with coffee and juice the breakfast staff did not speak any english  the hotel is in a nice neighborhood with some restaurants close by and a lot of shops closest metro station passy was closed during our stay but it is not a long walk to trocaderothe hotel was great and the stuff was extremely pleasant and took very good care of us the location is just extraordinary to get to know the eiffel tower and the surroundings i 100 would recommend it it was a bargain for that pricea good location close to eiffel tower passy is a good neighbor to hang out in metro close by a cozy and warm hotel with nice decor and helpful staff good breakfast room and smoking area in back courtyardeveryone at this hotel was extremely friendly and

hotel was cute off of a corner street and the interior decorations were subtle but comforting they had the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in the room was much smaller than expected however but we made do the customer service was very friendly and accommodating the location is perfect surrounded by a plethora of restaurants a walk away from the tower and a short drive to all the main sites

worth every penny  the service was top notch very helpful staff great location at very reasonable prices  thank you for a wonderful stayvery practical location in the centre of paris my room was a good size and very clean the hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive a couple of areas for improvement the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads it just brought down the whole room as did the freestanding cupboard when all the furnishing was so nice this looked a bit like a super cheap unit painted which stuck out a bit lastly although i was on the 6th floor at 630am i could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the roomsour group had a lovely stay at the hotel relais bosquet in paris  the location was perfect with respect to ease of access to buses and the metro  getting around was simple and safe  the rooms were small but clean the breakfast was a good value and the staff was helpful  our only complaints would be that the carpets and linens could stand refreshingi stayed 6 nights and couldnt have been happier with this boutique hotel the  reception staff was so pleasant and helpful in giving me directions everyday  on the metro or city map the location was fantastic with a short 2 blocks  to the metro which will get you anywhere in paris to see the sights or hop on the train to versailles or long distance travel reception gave me clear written directions from the train station which metro to take to etolle militaire stop to walk 2 blocks to the hotel   rue cler street with all the cafes and shops is just a 12 block away from the front door there is a market and bakery a couple of doors away a pharmacy 2

            "my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at the hotel grand powers  the hotel occupies a beautiful building and is just steps from the champs elysees and within walking distance of the eiffel tower  our room was chicly designed spacious and had a nice view over the cityscape below   most notable was the unfailing helpfulness and professionalism of each member of the hotels staff  they answered our requests immediately and were particularly informative and reassuring about current covid requirements in paris  i would unhesitatingly recommend this hotel to family and friendsi usually stay round the corner at four seasons george v but over last few years their prices have increased so much i wanted to look for an alternative  this hotel is second to none   location fantastic had a balcony room with view of the tower the bed is so comfy room was large and good value for paris ordered breakfast in bed absolutely perfectgrand powers is an absolute must stay this beautiful hotel and its amazing staff will become my family and friends mainstay in paris going forward i can not find one thing negative to mention thomas and his staff are amazingly accommodating and are wonderful people we usually stay at another 5star well known hotel nearby which is great as well but grand powers really out did them and has earned our loyaltycompletely lovely hotel experience  we loved our stay  a true five star experience and we felt completely pampered from the beautiful balcony view gorgeous bathroom to the service  we thoroughly enjoyed our staywas a great experience  nice atmosphere modern and victorian interiors  good location  clean and spacious rooms friendly and grateful receptionist  this hotel will be certainly my choice for next visiti recently stayed at hotel grand powers for 5 nights and i cannot wait to return the hotel is beautiful and my room was the nicest ive ever stayed in paris with a balcony and a view of the eiffel tower and the spa amenities were very relaxing the staff was so kind and welcoming especially the concierges they made me feel special every day the location was central to everything  i walked everywhere i cannot recommend the hotel enough  i will be sure to stay here again next time i visit mercii lived every single moment while staying at the grand powers starting wonderful and fast check in with complimentary champagne the room was exactly like i imagine typical luxurious parisian  apartment  modernart deco design with classic  empire  french spirit  definitely  the best boutique hotel in the most luxurious neighborhood of paris  cant wait to come back ps ask for 5th floor for the best viewi hate to write this review i stopped reviewing in ta a few years ago in protest  as it provided no incentive to continue unfortunately the entire experience here was so exceptional it would be unjust not to give credit for the exceptional service and experience we had there from the moment we entered the staff welcomed us by name  if we had a request it was addressed immediately without hesitation the room was spacious charming and immaculate with the view of the eiffel tower as promised the location is wonderfully adorned with the best shopping brands in the world good restaurants and sites paris is famous for a wonderful complimentary bottle of wine was brought to  our room for no reason  and greatly appreciated i cant say enough of the outstanding entirethe hotel is very well situated just near champselysees and metro stations upon arrival i was told that i was upgraded to junior suite i booked a deluxe room which was a very pleasant surprise the room was beautiful and clean the street in front of the hotel is a bit noisy which can be disturbing for a sensitive ear i always travel with my ear plugs so it wasnt a problem for me to sleep  the staff both at the front desk and at the restaurant are very friendly and it was a pleasure talking with them  i also had breakfast and lunch at the hotel and everything was fresh and delicious you can also have almond  oat milk for coffee and glutenfree bread which is great as this isnt an option in many places all in one i will definitely return to this hotel for mymy wife and i were very pleased with our stay at the hotel grand powers we have stayed at numerous hotels during our visits to the city and we agree that enjoyed our experience at the hotel the best thus far the comfort and the beauty of the room were great but it was the attention professionalism and courtesy of the staff that made it an exceptional experience for usi spent a lot of time researching hotels in paris and after switching from fauchon last minute i made the change to grand power purely for its location and reviews  ill start by saying im very glad i chose this hotel and it is justifiably high on tripadvisor having been on a 3 week trip around france and in many larger luxury properties this smaller boutique hotel was a welcome change and offers a much more personal refined service that is more difficult to achieve in larger establishments  check in was very warm and welcoming i found gonzalo very charming and authentic and he remained so very helpful and attentive throughout my stay regularly checking up on me the room was slightly delayed at check in but gonzalo insisted on more welcome drinks for me and was veryexcellent hotel great staff rooms perfect they let us shower in extra room after arriving from usa and our room was not ready free champagne at desk great breakfast beds perfect perfect location steps from arc de triomphe concierge helpful id stay here againthis is the best hotel ive stayed in paris the hotel grand power is ideally situated in the hearth of paris the breakfast is amazing staff is friendly and professional   i definitely recommend 55we spent a great 3day stay with my wife in this hotel we particularly appreciated the design the environment and the people of this place  smaller than the hotels we visited before the service was more personalized and attentive the bedrooms are fully equipped with an amazing view i highly recommend this hotel to enjoy great time in paris in a super nice and easy wayour hotel when in paris thats it we honestly feel like home when we visit  beautiful and typical parisian building just big enough so you still have the personal touch  from warm welcome on arrival to efficient departure everything is perfect  tried  several different rooms basic to more exclusive and they are all superbly newly decorated bright well

            "we stayed here for 3 nights at the end of august 19 location is 510 minutes walk from the eiffel towerand plenty of nice bars and restaurants yet the hotel itself is very quiet and relaxing after a long day of site seeing very pricey area though so be prepared to spend 100 on a meal in the evening for two hotel was a small compact boutique that offers bed and breakfast waking up to the smell of fresh croissant was a win friendly staff at reception room was very small however for a short city break for 2 this was just fine price was no different from 3 nights at a premier inn in the uk would recommendi highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was very clean pretty the beds were very comfortable and the most important is the location youre going to be in the safest and most beautiful neighborhood in paris liliana mendozawe chose this hotel due to its excellent location  right next to the trocadero and short walks to the tour eiffel and arc de triomphe it is well positioned for a short city break  30mins from gard du nord on the metro  the facilities provided were good  clean room comfy bed ensuite  i was surprised though at what was not included in the room wifi is available but costs extra tea and coffee facilities are in reception not the room and again there is a charge there was a safe but no key provided  i assumed it similarly cost extra but may be wrong  so 35 because those things i would expect as standard were not provided without additional payment other than that it is a nice hotel in an excellent locationperfect location perfect friendly personal parking lot to reserve nearby good continental breakfast clean nice and good restaurant in neighborhood location also in very nice neighborhood tres bienthe hotel is near the trocadero place one of the best place to see the eiffel tower near the chaillot palace near also le muse des monuments franais le muse de la marine  its very well locatedwe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel very nice staff clean hotel  rooms very cute and instagrammable patio perfect location as usual we booked for the dinner which is always amazing and tasty cant wait to come back and thanks to the teamwe were forced to cancel our trip due to the pandemic and hotel longchamp was the only accommodation that would not work with us on obtaining a refund or even letting us change our dates to one year later they did offer us to pay a change fee to change our dates a few months later but didnt offer this until less then one week before our planned stay which was too late to coordinate with the rest of our already rescheduled trip hotel longchamp had ignored all communication with us when trying to deal with this in a timely manner our experiences with all our other various flight and hotel reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasoni highly recommend this hotel mr idris and all the staff were so helpful  extremely nice the room was

hotel for 2 nights on holiday on arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great the hotel room was a great size bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy we were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly as we didnt know paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed would highly recommend staying herewe came here quite a few time these last years and i we wont change for another hotel

reservations etc really worked with us to refund or move our dates to a later time that all syncs up all in the same trip for this reason i cannot recommend this hotel they find any reasonhave to make a review since we are so happy with this hotel it really lived up to the expectations that we had it is just as fresh as in the pictures friendly staff and central location recommend itmy stay in the hotel was unforgettable the rooms are very private and clean the bathroom is very neat as well the staff was friendly and welcoming makes me feel like home is near to trocadero so you can go a enjoy the view of the beautiful eiffel towerclean rooms friendly staff really feels like home  breakfast is nice everything is fresh and delicious  reception is at your service 247 and that is great  one disadvantage  you can hear the noise in the hall while being in your roomi have chosen this hotel several times and will certainly stay there again it has an excellent location both for touristic and business trips the rooms are clean and comfortable the hotel staff is very attentive and helpfulhotel is in a great location staff was pleasant and helpful rooms are very tight standard double end bed was literally less than a foot from the wall no floor space to open your bags carpet in room and stairwell is kinda old dark and not clean looking stairwells seemed darkrecently stayed here with my family i have a young baby and was still made to feel welcome which has been a problem when travelling previously  great location nice clean hotel i would definitely recommendmy family stayed in a triple room 2 adults 1 child at this lovely little hotel and loved it  the location could not be beat it was a few minute walk to the metro and only a couple more to the eiffel tower the hotel staff was so kind and nice the breakfast each morning was very tasty and the room was a good size for our family when we return to paris we will definitely stay here againthe area was good for restaurants and close to metro station the problem came when they stated that the room was handicapped accessible not even the entry was accessible there were stairs and a smaller than average doorways the bathroom was very small and the toilet room was so small that not only the door would not open farther than 13 of the way but you had to straddle the toilet to close the door the biggest problem was that the room was too small i know that paris has small rooms but this was like a closet i am not exaggerating there was also construction so ask if there still is any as it was very loudvery nice staff shout out to edris and brightaquad room was nice 4 sistersfirst time in parisand clean location couldnt be betterwalking distance to the eiffel tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metrotrainhighly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit parislocation 1010 the administration 1010 we were absolutely happy in this hotel hope to come back here again and again  i dont know what else to say so im writing something to tripadviser   good bey see u soonmyself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to paris on easter weekend we experienced the wonderful paris friday traffic jams lol when we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick he gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as i had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot i certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes  restaurant are just amazing thank you hotel longchamp elyseesi first stayed here in 1984 and when it came time to visit again with my wife we did so this spring  the hotel is a small family affair where the front desk and other staff know you by name after the first night  it is close to two metro lines and within walking distance to the bois de bologne champs elysees eiffel tower trocodero museums and more and there are many good restaurants bistros chinese sushi portuguese patisseries the accommodations are first rate and the amenities are superior  looking forward to visiting again and soonmy husband and i stayed here for our ruby wedding anniversary and it is a fab hotel centrally situated near the eiffel tower and just a short walk from larc de triomphe metro station just a few minutes walk from hotel the staff here are so nice and really helpful we would highly recommend it to anyone travelling to paris bernie  patsywe had a great four night stay at hotel longchamp elysees the staff was very welcoming and willing to assist from the moment we arrived arriving on a saturday we had concerns about the protest but they immediately pulled out a map and explained areas we should avoid the rooms were on the smaller size  to be expected but were clean and well kept planning to be out for the majority of the day and returning late at night we were a little hesitant that we had to leave our hotel key at the desk but there was always someone there when we arrived back at night the location was great to easily travel by metro and the staff was more than willing to accommodate holding our luggage on our last day would certainly recommendnice hotel in paris france near the eiffel tower  great staff very helpful  room was small but comfortable and safe  no refrigerator in the room but europe doesnt usually provide refrigerators in rooms anyway  very small hotel but near many cafes metro and sightseeing  best hotel we stayed in during our tripi generally do not write poor reviews however i would not stay here again at all no lift to the room as you can see by the spiral staircase photos no offer of assistance to the room with baggage for my 70yr parents walls paper thin i could here kids yelling at all hours the ac is not controlled by you in your room the door key had to be left with front desk for the day its 2019 invest in proper doors locks the male at the front desk clerk was extremely rude  camille you were lovely and tried to make up but at some point you have to cut your losses  the food for breakfast what food eggs not cooked 2 baguettes small pieces of cheese a feeble pieces of ham etc disappointing decent location the eiffel tower was close and that is the best i can say for thislong champs elysees hotel is great exceeded my expectations few walks to restaurants grocery stores and to eiffel where it is great to see at night breakfast is great chooses are many hotel size is good bathroom is really spacious  hotel has mini english garden to smoke eat has concierge service that keeps your belongings safely hotel is clean  quiet   certainly will recommend to friends and family (Score: 0.6266)\n",

            "very nice hotel good price for its location a lot of attractions close by such as sacre coeur opera galleries lafayette etc we have walked once to the eiffel tower but its a good hour walking otherwise we used uber all the time works well the hotel is very cosy rooms are small but i would say its ideal for the ones who are visiting the city breakfast was good but there is also other places aroundloved this place cozy romantic and near to everything there is a metro station just around the corner as well lots of cafes and lots to do just around the corner the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you i recommend this place highlygreat location very good breakfast but when you ask for the internet they say that the only one is orange which obviously is insecure slow and basically does not work it is unacceptable that they don t give you a proper connection when there is a brittany one i won t return i have never lived something like thisvery clean hotel that is well located good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby bar wasnt open at any time and a paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge it was only when paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid forstayed for 3 nights last week check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout our room was a fairly small but typical of paris hotels a comfy bed and well decorated a clean bathroom and good warm working shower the location is excellent not far from gare du nord main train station the neighborhood is brilliant lots of coffee shops and eateries within walking distance montmartrepigalle area approx 15 mins and sacre cour cathedrale 2025 mins awayhubs and i stayed here for 4 nights in a non smoking room on 1st floor at far end from main stairs pleasant stay clean and comfortable room ac works well bathroom is good size clean and working in good condition staff are cheerful and friendly we will definitely stay here again for next triproom was a little more spacious than the typically smaller hotel rooms on paris and has air conditioning although at the time of our visit not working at its best front desk was able to give us a fan and that made a big difference   comfy bed wonderful soaker tub and windows that spill out into the courtyard  quiet   literally walk out the door and you are have cafes and shops waiting for you  only a few minutes walk to galeries lafayette and its breathtaking stain glassed ceiling   friendly staff great location and comfortable roomsthe location is very parisien  the neighborhood offering a wide range of specialities gourmet cafeteria restaurants for one person the public transportation is ok i came by roissybus from ch de gaule airport 12 euros one stop at opra  the first night room was clean and nice view on the street but very noisy and cold because the windows are not closing properly if this issue will be settled the room is ok the air conditioning is not working in cold season so the only heating source was the bathroom heater keeping the bathroom door open the second night i change the room with a bigger and soundproofed one but dark and sad  the backyard with walls here no heating at all on my request they provide a mobile air flow device i cant used it during the nightthe staff are warm and welcoming and eager to help the rooms are on the small side but adequate for a short stay we had a room with a magnificent view of the sacre couer all lit up at night there are bars and restaurants nearby that offer a variety of different cuisines and range from the inexpensive to mid top endwe stayed here for 3 nights and it was adequate but id spend a few  more and find something better  upon arrival we checked in and the guy on reception wasnt that friendly he barely lifted his head to talk to us he gave up our room number and key and that was it we werent given any directions to our room and after a minute had to ask where was the lift and what floor were we on before he could be bothered to tell us  omg the lift is tiny 2 adults and 2 small suitcases at a max so we just used the stairs after that the room was ok but the shower was broken and you had to stand in it holding the shower  above your head which apparently is ok when we complained to the woman at reception next day and every morning we complained about the shower been broken but thestayed here for three night over new year  booked a standard double which was bard on the 4th floor the room are on the small side but clean bathroom is adequate there are tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to leave reminders so room service would leave replacements the hotel is in a superb location for the notredame lorette metro and all the main shopping areas fare du nord is a 15 minute walk and if youre fit enough 20 minutes from the sacrecoure lots of bars and fabulous bistros nearbypro  nice rooms  location 2 metro lines and buses in close vicinity many restaurantsbars couple of minutes to montmartre 30 min by foot to the louvre  concierge at checkin was lovely  5th floor rooms have minibalconys more like french windows  normal hand shower  overhead shower  modern rooms trendy bar on the bottom floor  con  power outlets and light switches are illuminated whatever for and that makes the room much to bright to sleep comfortably  bed tiny for 2 people  pillows lumpy  uncomfortable  thin walls could hear people in neighbouring room enjoying themselves  concierge couldnt tell us where to get stamps  breakfast was a bit poor for the price  staff overseeing the breakfast buffet was kinda creepy and weird  room was not reallyi only stayed here for one quick night before leaving paris i found my room neat enough though on the first floor i was subjected to the street noises that naturally occur in a large city the room was clean if a bit frayed at the edges the staff was very friendly and spoke good englishmy wife and i decided to travel europe to celebrate our birthdays  first stop paris we  picked hotel brittany due to its location specifically to moulin rouge but also its proximity to many attractions and a reasonable price  upon arrival we were slightly disappointed tired after a ten hour flight we needed a quick nap and shower  the room was very small and had some watermarking discoloration on the ceiling and no view despite asking for a decent room upon check in  i let the manager know that i had some issues with the room and that it was not exactly what we had in mind for our four days in paris  we were given a reasonable upgrade that really made the difference in our stay  the staff were helpful and the hotel was really quite charming the location was perfect forthis was my second stay at this hotel and again it didnt disappoint friendly helpful staff nice and clean very central to a lot of attractions all within walking distance a metro station just around the corner for those longer trips  i will definitely be back againme and my friend stayed here for a short break for 4 nights the hotel itself was beautifully kept very nice and helpful staff who always had a smile on their faces  the only downside to the hotel itself is that there isnt anywhere to get a coffee apart from at breakfast and when we asked for milk they said they only had cream  as we were leaving our bathroom seemed to have acquired a number of ants not to sure where they were coming from i wouldve mentioned it but we had to check out  the eiffel tower notre damn champslyses and the main marathon is approximately 30 mins to 1 hour away by walking depending on if you stop to take in the sights   all in all a lovely little boutique guest house with lots of character friendly staff and quirky bits i wouldit was a pure pleasure to spent a weeekend in this charming hotel located in lovely neighbourhood close to bars cafes and restaurants walking distance to city centre and main attractions you wont be disappointed with superb customer service and lovely fresh tasty brrakfast i am sure you will fall in love with main restaurant and bar area where you can grab a glass of wine or cocktail on afternoon thank you for lovely stay and i look forward to back here again very sooni choose the brittany hotel because i remembered it from my first time in paris 30 years ago  that is true  naturally things change but when i looked it up and saw that it was still in existence read the reviews and saw the rate i booked it  i am very happy that i did  the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the notre dame de lorette metro stop in a nontouristy area of paris  if you want to exit your hotel and be among all the tourists and the most popular sights this might not be for you  but if youre like me and you want to walk the streets and feel as though you are in a real parisian neighborhood i would highly recommend it  it is a very short walk to the opera and the stores on blvd haussmann and a slightly longer but still reasonable walk up to montmartre  theno complaints the entire staff was very friendly and they were all bi or multi lingual i stayed in a cozy room so it was small but i wasnt in it very much the lift is tiny capacity three people but its not the end of the world if you have to let one person go up and wait for it to come back down  wifi worked fine was a little slow once or twice but nothing significant  bus and metro options are very nearby and its within walking distance of montmartre and three of the major train stations paris has a fantastic public transportation app so its really easy to catch a bus or the metro to the city center like around the eiffel tower theres a bakery right around the corner and lots of restaurants nearby as well  their early booking discount was phenomenal when ibooked 7 weeks prior for a 4 night stay was told on check in would have to move after 2 nights due to planned work surely should have planned the bookings better but as there was noisy work going on in the room above thought it would be better to move until we realised we were immediately below our original room so had noise again   the hotel is in a great area and we would stay in this area again the final straw was out airport taxi which we booked on day 2 reminded reception on day 3 and the final night only to be told half an hour before we were due to leave they nothing had been booked the very unhelpful man on reception just told us to try uber ourselves as everyone was on strike after checking the metro was running which it was but 5 changes with 4 casesthis hotel is very central in paris easy walking distance to the sacred heart cathedral

warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit

back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the

itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord

            "my wife and i spent 4 nights at this hotel which is located just a short walk from the gare de lyon train station and just steps from the bastille round about our room was in the back facing a side street and it was very quiet the metro has lines just steps away plus many good restaurants we ate at le coq rico in the monmartre a la biche au bois two blocks away au temps des cerises just on the marais border and les coquettes de christian constant close to eiffel all of these restaurants offer terrific food at reasonable prices the room at pavillon bastille had a small coolerand available coffee and teathere is a large grocery about 1 12 blocks toward the train stationthe entire hotel was clean and well taken care of breakfast in the basement was also very goodvery reasonably priced hotel that is wellkept booked directly on site and received free breakfast cant complain about the bedroom and bathroom  comfortable and clean  its located very close to bastille station 5 minute walk and possibly a 15 minute walk to gare de lyon if you are driving it is conveniently located in front of opera house parking stationthis hotel was a nice surprise after having spent many nights in noisy andor uncomfortable paris hotels a small place just off the place de la bastille and lots of activity the hotel is surprisingly quiet with low internal traffic ie hallway chatter the rooms come with whatever you need from a clothesline in the bath to a minibar the staff is very accommodating and friendly and the morning breakfast is yummy and plentiful plus the coffee machine is ready to provide whatever you like from an espresso to a big cup of classic coffee i will certainly return mercithe best bit of this hotel is the staff  very friendly helpful especially since we arrived during a rail strike special thanks go to indural  who organised taxi transport back to cdg when the rotten sncf were on strike and there were no trains our room was in a perfect position  top floor at the end so noone next door to disturb us our room was also facing a side street so we had no traffic noise we did not have breakfast as all hotels charge far too much so we went to a local cafe which was only five minutes away we had a good selection of tv programmes  cnn bbc world and a few french sports programmes the hotel is in an ideal place for metro bars restaurants and visiting the local area would stay there again in an instanta nice hotel in a typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit pariscant fault the location staff are welcoming and helpful and the rooms are clean with pleasant lighting the beds are as small as they come comfortable enough and it means a bit more floor space for the suitcases great to have a kettle in the room as well as coffee facilities in reception would stay againthe room was very nice and clean  however we had the desk call us a taxi on the morning of 1082021 and the driver charged us 421 to go to beauvais airport  we did expect to pay about 150 because of what we had researched but this was definitely wrong  i hope they dont continue  calling this taxi companyvery clean and tidy place is reasonably priced especially for the time of year tour de france good location where you can easily get to locations by half hour to fourth five minute walk or public transport 5 mins away beds are comfortable breakfast was average for a buffetif the prices were higher for this small chic hotel it would be called a boutique hotel but the news here is that it is everything that boutique hotels are but without the crazy prices   our double room was nicely decorated with a super comfortable bed and sleek bed covers and soft go to sleep pillows easy access wifi was a huge plus  as were the hefty towels in the bathroom which were lovely after a hot shower caveat  the hair dryer is a little strange so if thats important you might bring your own travel hair dryer    the staff speaks english and could not have been nicer when our flight was cancelled we called from the airport and the front desk was very accommodating about just giving us our same room   breakfast comes with the room  also a big plus  soeverything you would expect from a threestar hotel good central location being a couple of

typical old french area of paris close to the center very comfortable and simple room in an old building flowered a really discret and friendly ambiance a great place to visit parisme and my teenage

the staff were very friendly even helped us inquire with a restaurant for dinner location is convenient just minutes from the bastille july column and the metro station unfortunately we were here during the metro strikes so did not take advantage of it overall a very pleasant staywe spent 3 nights here on a recent visit to paris the hotel was easily accessed from the metro from our arrival point on the eurostar with only a short stroll from bastille metro stop the lady at reception when we arrived was warm and friendly and thankfully fluent in english as our french was very limited we found the room small but more than adequate for a couple who were there only to sleep the bed was very comfortable ensuring a restful sleep and the room cleaned daily with a safe in the room we felt confident that passports and credit cards were safely left there we did not have breakfast at the hotel so unable to comment on this the price did however seem quite reasonable particularly when considering the cost of meals in paris it needs to be noted that thevery convenient place for stay in paris excellent access to any transport nice staff quiet rooms good start point to discover galeries historic buildings or follow the life in streets from typical cafswe had a very enjoyable couple of nights staying in this hotel the bed was very large and comfortable and the breakfast selection was brilliant it is very well located for visiting paris and would definitely recommendwatch out if you stay here as my sister and i had money stolen from a locked bag in our hotel room not a good start to our holiday   otherwise it is a fairly standard hotel in a good location close to the gare de lyonthe hotel has clean rooms a good and rich breakfast the rooms were a bit small but it was very clean he deserves his choice and because of his honor and because of his very good standing next to the undergroundme and my teenage daughter loved our stay at this hotel in the very

with our reservation arrangements in advance  last but not least hotel pavillon bastille is located along metro line no1 the one that is automatically driven and working in spite of any traffic strikea receptionist answered my questions kindly and helped me a lot for my museum tickets program she also speaks good english  the location of this hotel is very convenient to see opera or ballet at opera bastillewe had a great experience staff of the hotel was friendly the rooms were clean and comfortable and the price was rightto top it off the hotel was on walking distance of the city centre at least for uswe had an overnighter here after finishing our 3 week cycle tour of southeastern france  the location was handy for getting cross town to gare du nord for our return leg  staff were friendly and couldnt really fault the room for a short stay  we might have been more forgiving due to our many nights under canvas on the bicycling tour   hotel has a useful side ramp for wheeled access to the lobby and a nice little gated outdoor area at the front   price was reasonable for paris and it was pretty much a standard type hotel  weve stayed in better and worse in our dozen or so visits to the cityfriendly nice little hotel clean budget about 100 eur per night are the first words coming to mind it is perfectly located at walking distance from bastille subway etc and also very close to the train station gare de lyon i walked there without problem  the room with 2 twin beds was spacious quiet thanks to good windows isolation a little noise from people passing through the corridor though with confortable bed simple but nice decoration and goodcreanfunctional bathroom the staff was very nice 24h   make sure to book directly from their website as the price is the same than other portals but more importantly they offer breakfast if you book with their site worth it to save a few bucks for a good and complete breakfast the croissants were to die formy husband and i stayed in this hotel for 8 nights on the first leg of our trip to europe in  september of 2019  we thought the hotel was very nice yes the rooms were a bit small but we did not feel cramped at all we had plenty of room for the little bit of time we spent in the room  we were surprised how quiet the area was  and we had a room facing rue de lyon it was very close to the bastille metro stop from where you could get everywhere after 8 days of riding the metro all over in paris we became very familiar with the system  the room and bathroom were very clean the bed and pillows comfortable we had very restful nights after exploring paris  we did not get the breakfast  as we wanted to go out and explore options for breakfast so i can not comment on (Score: 0.4390)\n",

nicely decorated rooms although the space is small like every hotel in paris the room is well organised the hotel also has a lovely little reception area for breakfast and has a well equipped gym and sauna we were impressed with this especially as the hotel is so central   the staff are also very friendly and helpful we were particularly grateful as we had initially booked our stay during the paris strikes and had to rebook as the eurostar was not running despite booking on a nonrefundable date the hotel kindly honoured our booking and allowed us to change dates to which we were very grateful  we would definitelyhotel staff were very friendly the room was exactly the same as in the pictures the bathroom was clean and tidy  perfect for a romantic weekend very central within walking

in paris after returning from amsterdam we had an early flight in and were able to check into our room early around 1100am which was a great surprise our room was very comfortable and the hotel itself was clean great location and quiet   we were meant to leave the next morning to get our flight back to the us but my husband became ill with what we now think was extreme stomach poisoning we did not eat at the hotel he was sick enough that we couldnt get on our flight and instead had to go to the er to make sure he was okay i wish i had gotten the employees name who helped us call a cab talked to the cab drive in french and told him exactly where to go and was just so compassionate when we returned the same employee was therethe staff have been amazing and made this feel like a home we are here for a 2 week stay and on day 3 they asked if i wanted to switch rooms to a lower floor access to an outside area since they noticed i smoked they offered to move us at no additional cost they have given fantastic recommendations and have been incredibly sweet  book your paris stay here you wont regret itperfect location close to the metro and a very quiet room the  real great thing about

were very friendly and helpful the reception area is very clean modern and stylish and the room was very comfortable   we were lucky and were given an upgrade to a delux room for our stay  whilst the rooms are small as to be expected in paris they are beautifully decorated and in immaculate condition it had everything we needed as well as a tv hidden in the mirror which was very cool  we had to preorder breakfast due to covid 19 which was brought to our room which personally i loved as it was like have fresh continental breakfast in bed no hot food on the menu however which my friend was disappointed with but i loved the fresh fruit baguettes and pastries   we didnt use the gym in the basement but had athe staff was great and welcoming and the whole experience was very pleasant due to covid the breakfast could have been better but overall it was great the sauna and hammam space is beautiful and clean i would very recommend the hoteli cannot recommend this hotel highly enough

per metro or walkink verry friendly staff the house is modern but has charm clean room and a good breakfast we got a good suggestion for lunchclean convenient and next to the gare de lyon the staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay easy walk to the notre dame dining and a small supermarket right down the street we would stay here againi have already been to the hotel palym three times and have always been very satisfied the location directly at the gare de lyon is very practical and the metro in the train station offers a good connection to the center of paris the hotel is not particularly large and therefore somehow personal the single rooms are not large but have everything you needaccidental tgv to paris from avignon requiring a quick search for overnight accommodation near the train station  the hotel is literally across the street from the station and surrounded by restaurants featuring different cuisine  friendly staff and importantly they provide spare pillows  got a good rate for accommodation that equalled the higher end hotel i stayed at during vin paris 2020 future stops in paris for meetings will see me returnmy first reason for the choice is the very good location near railway station but i found a room comfortable and clean and cleverly furnished lightening well thought  a very pleasant night of rest i definitely recommend itwe really didnt expect such a wonderful and clean hotel just 4 minutes from the train station  staff was nice and helpful rooms were quiet and the breakfast was good  highly recommend for overnight stayclean great service comfortable bed and right at gare lyon  they take extra care to make sure everyone is safe and comfortable during covid  breakfast is delivered to our room  the front desk people are the bestnice hotel just out of the real center of paris the hotel is very close top gare de lyon which makes it also very close to the paris islands bastille louvre les halles etc although near the road and the railway station the rooms are isolated so you wont hear traffic and other noises rooms are small but comfortable with everything you need breakfeast was very sufficient to start your dayi spend a lot of time in paris for work and have stayed at a lot of hotels this is among the best that i have used it is consistently excellent  the rooms are a good size for paris with comfortable beds and practical shower rooms the front desk staff are always helpful polite and responsive and the staff that clean the rooms are very good at what they do  the breakfast is excellent too lovely bread good coffee scrambled egg bacon croissants and more for me the only thing are that are missing is some kind of fruit salad although there is fresh fruit available and ketchup but i really do feel ashamed to type that  the location is good with the gare de lyon on your doorstep and despite me usually arriving at montparnasse there is a very handy bus that goesbecause it is so near the gate dr lyon and because we were traveling by train we stayed here  this is not a luxury hotel  under renovation for quite some time it is coming along  the lobby floor is incomplete but not unpleasant the staff was very courteous and helpful rooms are small but very clean an easy walk to the bastille and across the street from the train station  at the opposite end of the street we discovered le duc de richelieu it is a charming restaurant with personal  friendly service nice wine and good food loved iti chose this hotel due to its proximity to the gare de lyon i am moving to montpellier and hoped to find regular hotel in paris near to the train there are plusses but nothing makes up for the owner and staff minuses the room a single was small even by paris standards with no luggage stand the suitcase lived on the floor and had to be constantly kicked aside the shower was so small that you shouldnt take this room is you are at all hefty i am 53106 when i twice dropped the soap i seriously hit my head on the sharp door handle on the way up tip step outside the shower retrieve the soap and step back in lots of noise through the thin walls even with their normal activity bring earplugs for that my other gripe was the way they handled the lobby renovationi chose this hotel because i had to take an early morning train  the location is very convenient  the rooms are comfortable well equipped and brand new  the staff is very pleasant  i highly recommend ithotel is clean and neat exactly what we are looking for its center location is wonderful close to gare de lyon and walking distance to some paris attraction if you like to walk around as to explore paris its location is really good despite so close to the downtown and busy area it is not noisy at all in the roomgreat location facing the gare de lyon but the street was quiet the room was very clean and that was reassuring considering the circumstances breakfast was great  free for kids staff was nice and friendly highly recommendedi have been in this hotel before and will go there again whenever spending time in paris the hotel is very well situated  near gare de lyon and metro  and is good value for money the rooms are nice and the staff is very friendlywe stayed here for a weekend trip to paris was a nice clean comfortable hotel we were surprised by the for paris spacious room with a king size bed the toilet on the other hand was a bit small my knees knocked against the door the bathroom was nice with a big shower breakfast was served in the room due to covid was a decent breakfast location was excellent if you need to use public transport across from gare de lyon in a side street super for catching the metro  only negatives the airconditioning didnt work the 2nd night but it wasnt too bad and we woke up a few times due to people out on the street shouting in the middle of the night we had a room on the street side but the hotel cant do much about that  all in all we enjoyed our stay and werethe hotel rooms were new clean comfortable bed was comfortabl the hotel was at  great location very close to the gare de lyon  good for a quick overnight stay  staff was efficient and friendly would stay againwe stopped at the palym hotel with my daughter and it was really disappointing of all our 20 years old travel stories this was the worst hotel and most terrible staff that is why i am writing this review this is the first time i experienced so much bad customer service the staff was really unfriendly and behaved creepily the hotel is really small and the rooms even smaller and really cold so after checking out we left a couple of bags in the hotels luggage compartment when we returned to the hotel to pick up the bags the man at the reception shouted at us to disappear immediately because of the covid i went to the bathroom for about 5 mins fillowed by my daughter went to the bathroom for the same time i told the man from the staff that when my daughter comes out ofsmall but charming room clean and comfortable practical and clean bathroom nice shower very quiet hotel despite the proximity of the train station very convenient location very

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.3414)\n",

hotel was cute off of a corner street and the interior decorations were subtle but comforting they had the most comfortable beds ive ever slept in the room was much smaller than expected however but we made do the customer service was very friendly and accommodating the location is perfect surrounded by a plethora of restaurants a walk away from the tower and a short drive to all the main sites definitely staying again for my next trip to parisperfect location and a view of eiffel tower from room was a nice surprise lots of cafes and restaurants around check in check out very smooth and

you to go to and from the airportwe enjoyed a wonderful and welcoming stay at the hotel relais bosquet paris  we requested the upgrade to the beautiful eiffel tower view at an extra charge and it was worth every penny  the service was top notch very helpful staff great location at very reasonable prices  thank you for a wonderful stayvery practical location in the centre of paris my room was a good size and very clean the hotel is well looked after and common parts very attractive a couple of areas for improvement the carpet in a corner of my room was in a terrible state like it had been eaten by moth or just worn to the threads it just brought down the whole room as did the freestanding cupboard when all the furnishing was so nice this looked a bit like a super cheap unit painted which stuck out a bit lastly although i was on the 6th floor at 630am i could smell the fumes of breakfast being prepared ventilation of the kitchen should be better separated from the roomsour group had a lovely stay at the hotel relais bosquet in paris  the location was perfect with respect to ease of access to buses and the metro  getting around was simple and safe  the rooms were small but clean the breakfast was a good value and the staff was helpful  our only complaints would be that the carpets and linens could stand refreshingi stayed 6 nights and couldnt have been happier with this boutique hotel the  reception staff was so pleasant and helpful in giving me directions everyday  on the metro or city map the location was fantastic with a short 2 blocks  to the metro which will get you anywhere in paris to see the sights or hop on the train to versailles or long distance travel reception gave me clear written directions from the train station which metro to take to etolle militaire stop to walk 2 blocks to the hotel   rue cler street with all the cafes and shops is just a 12 block away from the front door there is a market and bakery a couple of doors away a pharmacy 2 blocks away to get your covid test prior to your return flight to the us my upgraded room  53 was on the 5th floor with ait was a great experience since the moment of the check in people at front desk

short walk to the metro for everything else rue de passy itself is lovely especially at night as it has overhead lights all the way along with many restaurants on close proximity the room i had was

and we would definitely recommend it and look forward to returning soonthe 4 of us 2 retired couples from the sonoma county ca wine country ended up at this hotel after 2 covid related rebookings with another hotel that sent our booking to the hotel passy eiffel as a result of not reopening as planned   got all that  the change of booking proved to be a great one at that as our original hotel was a 2 and the hotel passy eiffel is a 3  the hotel is wellsituated with a view of the eiffel tower  we landed in paris on july 24 bastille day and enjoyed the best fireworks show ever from our window  truth be known there was a little leaning out of  the window involved  there is a great pastry shop a few doors down the source for  morning croissants and coffee which we would bring back to the hotel and enjoy in a small and verywe had a room for 3 it was very roomy to be a paris room the bathroom as well all clean and nice from our french balcony we could see the eiffel tour the front desk was helpful breakfast was boring french only baguette and croissant with coffee and juice the breakfast staff did not speak any english  the hotel is in a nice neighborhood with some restaurants close by and a lot of shops closest metro station passy was closed during our stay but it is not a long walk to trocaderothe hotel was great and the stuff was extremely pleasant and took very good care of us the location is just extraordinary to get to know the eiffel tower and the surroundings i 100 would recommend it it was a bargain for that pricea good location close to eiffel tower passy is a good

            "the location of the hotel is perfect 1 block away from the eiffel tower we stayed at the hotel because we booked a room with a balcony view of the hotel the view was amazing literally right next to it   overall the hotel was great hotel was clean and front desk personnel were very helpful and welcoming   on our last day we decided to get breakfast at the hotel since we were leaving on a an international flight the breakfast was amazing and well stocked but was kind of pricey 30 euros for each adult1 my rooms were not ready upon my arrival  i had ordered two connecting rooms for me and my twin daughters on my arrival at 1 pm which was announced only one room was ready i had to take a business call while asking my daughters to keep silent for 3 hours 2 i had to call reception multiple times to ask when the second room was finally going to be ready 3 no parking was available hotel description stating otherwise i had to assertively ask reception to find a solution to park my car no replacement solution offered proactively 4 i am a gold member and when i complained again  very angrily at my checkout i was offered a 150 euros discount off my 1000 euro bill  whereas i should have been offered at least one of the two rooms for the full stay i will noteven the view of eiffel tower cannot be complained but the staff is the worst ad ive ever experienced  on the day i arrived my husband cannot find a place to park even i ask the security at the door but he has no idea to help my husband has to park very far in the main street and work to the hotel with a big suitcase then  i came first at the reception with my baby all the receptionist just looked at me like i am lost without any welcome until the security inside of the hotel not the useless security outdoor help me with my baby stroller  finally i arrived in front of one man receptionist he told me that not this way because maybe i come here just for looking like a homeless until i said that i have a booking he looked at me with a weird face  ask me rudelyour travel company placed us at the pullman and we were delighted  it is a modern luxurious hotel and easy to like but dont take our word while we were there the french olympic basketball team stayed at the hotel and we have heard the many of the tennis players from the french open were guests as well the room are quiet and up to date with electric plugs that conform to any device you  might have  breakfast was wonderful with a good selection and madetoorder eggs the only down side we encountered was a very late cleaning of our room after a long day sightseeing but the staff sent a cleaning crew to the room very quickly be sure to visit the 10th floor restaurantbar on the hour after dark as the tower will have a surprise for you on the houri have enjoyed my stay at the hotel and my room breakfast was great also the proaction in regards of covid19 was very good staff so polite  i would like to thank the team of the hotel all i have enjoyed my visitwe stayed at pullman for our first wedding anniversary antonio at the reception was brilliant he upgraded us to a room with eiffel tower view no balcony but who stays in the room in paris anyway our stay was absolutely brilliant the breakfast was very good too they also gave us a food package to go on our checkout at 4 am the staff was super friendly and very helpful we will definitely come back and also recommend to our friendsthe view is awesome at first you  think its going to be a partial view  but from our room it was perfect  there was a party on the street every night it was mthnot even the weekend  i was supposed to have a king size bed went down to complain and was told to just  push them together the deadbolt didnt work tried to have a drink in the outdoor restaurant and was told we needed a reservation there was nobody there he let us sit but said we would have to move if people with reservations came in nobody came to serve usthe manager came over and said we could sit but if someone with reservations came in wed have to move we left how do you not know how many tables and reservations you have what a jerk the breakfast people were very nicepros great location nice hotel quick check in and out amazing view of the eiffel tower from our room very comfortable bed last but not least the food was amazing  cons huge carpet stain near bed no bathrobesquick check in room small as booked upgrade to a higher category for diamond status not included good hotel location breakfast buffet sufficient nice top floor restaurant unfortunately we were unable to get a table on saturday night despite being flexible in terms of the available time its hard the hotel did not react in any way on the birthday even a greeting card was not delivered i have never experienced such an approach beforerecently my husband and i took a trip to paris france unfortunately we booked the pullman hotel near the eiffel tower and had a terrible experience   during our first hour in our room someone opened our door without knocking they ended up leaving right away and i could not get a good look at them due to me trying to get my dogs away from the door when addressing it with the front desk they told me i should have put a sign on the front door saying do not distribute it turns out that housekeeping opened our door in my opinion no one should walk into your room without knocking i do not care if it house keeper or room service they should always knock but needless to say they were unbothered that housekeeping just walked into our room and did not even apologizethe staff its wonderful and the manager patrick complements your stay  highly recommended we love the hotel  the views from the rooftop restaurant nice breakfast inside the hotel  beautiful and we definitely going back in decembervery nice hotel everything was perfect  location rooms breakfast and service however room had some issues the air conditioning didnt work for a while other than that definitely met my expectations would stay again in the future and recommend it to othersvia hotelscom i booked a deluxe room 1 king bed balcony view eiffel tower view at the pullman paris which is indeed located very close to the eiffel tower   the reception area is not too exciting but check in was fairly quick and efficient   the room itself was a bit on the small side but otherwise pretty nice with a decent bathroom no tub but only shower though of course the main selling point of the room is the balcony which features a view of the eiffel tower you cant see the view from inside the room itself unfortunately   the balcony is a bit narrow but it does have chairs that allow you to sit and enjoy the spectacular view of the eiffel tower at night it is almost more impressive when it all lights up and sparkles once an hour the rest of thewe had been invited by clients who live in paris we had asked to be close to the eiffel tower or at least to have a view of this tower upon our arrival we had been very well received the room was ready for noon we had a very nice view of the eiffel tower excellent bedding nice bathroom excellent breakfast and all the staff had been very goodim writing this review as i lie awake at ten oclock at night listening to construction noise down on the street that has been so loud i cant get to sleep im in what id call a twin bed even though my husband prepaid handsomely for a king bed room when we told one of the women at the desk this afternoon we thought maybe wed been given the wrong room she said no that was a king and guests simply push the two beds together to make a king bed push the two beds together have you ever heard of that me eitherbest hotel we ever been there you can fell like you are a part of paris all desired comfort with an awesome view from the balcony since the checkin to checkout so the staff creat the most pleasant atmospheregorgeous hotel  security close to entrance felt very safe  ask for a view of the eiffel tower  facing rooms   balcony if possible   eiffel sparkles starting at 8 pm each night quiet  and rooms well done  staff in restaurant very attentive food amazing  security and front desk  fabulous  close to the train and many restaurants and shops rooms are spacious and modern  nice good bed comfort noise insulation can be improved noises from room above and outside difficult in q big city i know bathroom toilet in bathroom not seperate a rainshower very low water pressure breakfast standard for this kind of hotel nothing special though i would eat breakfast outside of the hotel cheaper and better service of staff  friendly and kind location close to tour eiffel only one subway line 6 and rer line nearby very expensive so price quality is just average one could say you pay for the location but most paris hotels are close to a famous monumentmuseumi did love the way of communication straight to the point actually their office was very fast i also felt

extensive breakfast buffet to suit all tastes  rooms are functional and sufficiently spacious too  great staff and strict to enforce covid protocols which i applaudhow often do you get to paris so why not splurge a little and get a fantastic view and be just a block away from the tower the hotel is very nice and updated they have a restaurant that has seating with a tower view the staff was helpful and friendly there are plenty of outdoor cafes within walking distance for food or drinks walking distance to gift shops drug store and grocery store make sure to reserve a tower view room if you want

            "very nice hotel good price for its location a lot of attractions close by such as sacre coeur opera galleries lafayette etc we have walked once to the eiffel tower but its a good hour walking otherwise we used uber all the time works well the hotel is very cosy rooms are small but i would say its ideal for the ones who are visiting the city breakfast was good but there is also other places aroundloved this place cozy romantic and near to everything there is a metro station just around the corner as well lots of cafes and lots to do just around the corner the staff is very friendly and always willing to help you i recommend this place highlygreat location very good breakfast but when you ask for the internet they say that the only one is orange which obviously is insecure slow and basically does not work it is unacceptable that they don t give you a proper connection when there is a brittany one i won t return i have never lived something like thisvery clean hotel that is well located good sized bathroom and nicely decorated lobby bar wasnt open at any time and a paris pass was delivered that reception denied any knowledge it was only when paris pass phoned reception they could be bothered finding it reception seemed pushy in getting us to take a taxi they recommend to the airport rather than we had booked and paid forstayed for 3 nights last week check in was easy and staff very pleasant throughout our room was a fairly small but typical of paris hotels a comfy bed and well decorated a clean bathroom and good warm working shower the location is excellent not far from gare du nord main train station the neighborhood is brilliant lots of coffee shops and eateries within walking distance montmartrepigalle area approx 15 mins and sacre cour cathedrale 2025 mins awayhubs and i stayed here for 4 nights in a non smoking room on 1st floor at far end from main stairs pleasant stay clean and comfortable room ac works well bathroom is good size clean and working in good condition staff are cheerful and friendly we will definitely stay here again for next triproom was a little more spacious than the typically smaller hotel rooms on paris and has air conditioning although at the time of our visit not working at its best front desk was able to give us a fan and that made a big difference   comfy bed wonderful soaker tub and windows that spill out into the courtyard  quiet   literally walk out the door and you are have cafes and shops waiting for you  only a few minutes walk to galeries lafayette and its breathtaking stain glassed ceiling   friendly staff great location and comfortable roomsthe location is very parisien  the neighborhood offering a wide range of specialities gourmet cafeteria restaurants for one person the public transportation is ok i came by roissybus from ch de gaule airport 12 euros one stop at opra  the first night room was clean and nice view on the street but very noisy and cold because the windows are not closing properly if this issue will be settled the room is ok the air conditioning is not working in cold season so the only heating source was the bathroom heater keeping the bathroom door open the second night i change the room with a bigger and soundproofed one but dark and sad  the backyard with walls here no heating at all on my request they provide a mobile air flow device i cant used it during the nightthe staff are warm and welcoming and eager to help the rooms are on the small side but adequate for a short stay we had a room with a magnificent view of the sacre couer all lit up at night there are bars and restaurants nearby that offer a variety of different cuisines and range from the inexpensive to mid top endwe stayed here for 3 nights and it was adequate but id spend a few  more and find something better  upon arrival we checked in and the guy on reception wasnt that friendly he barely lifted his head to talk to us he gave up our room number and key and that was it we werent given any directions to our room and after a minute had to ask where was the lift and what floor were we on before he could be bothered to tell us  omg the lift is tiny 2 adults and 2 small suitcases at a max so we just used the stairs after that the room was ok but the shower was broken and you had to stand in it holding the shower  above your head which apparently is ok when we complained to the woman at reception next day and every morning we complained about the shower been broken but thestayed here for three night over new year  booked a standard double which was bard on the 4th floor the room are on the small side but clean bathroom is adequate there are tea and coffee facilities in the room but we had to leave reminders so room service would leave replacements the hotel is in a superb location for the notredame lorette metro and all the main shopping areas fare du nord is a 15 minute walk and if youre fit enough 20 minutes from the sacrecoure lots of bars and fabulous bistros nearbypro  nice rooms  location 2 metro lines and buses in close vicinity many restaurantsbars couple of minutes to montmartre 30 min by foot to the louvre  concierge at checkin was lovely  5th floor rooms have minibalconys more like french windows  normal hand shower  overhead shower  modern rooms trendy bar on the bottom floor  con  power outlets and light switches are illuminated whatever for and that makes the room much to bright to sleep comfortably  bed tiny for 2 people  pillows lumpy  uncomfortable  thin walls could hear people in neighbouring room enjoying themselves  concierge couldnt tell us where to get stamps  breakfast was a bit poor for the price  staff overseeing the breakfast buffet was kinda creepy and weird  room was not reallyi only stayed here for one quick night before leaving paris i found my room neat enough though on the first floor i was subjected to the street noises that naturally occur in a large city the room was clean if a bit frayed at the edges the staff was very friendly and spoke good englishmy wife and i decided to travel europe to celebrate our birthdays  first stop paris we  picked hotel brittany due to its location specifically to moulin rouge but also its proximity to many attractions and a reasonable price  upon arrival we were slightly disappointed tired after a ten hour flight we needed a quick nap and shower  the room was very small and had some watermarking discoloration on the ceiling and no view despite asking for a decent room upon check in  i let the manager know that i had some issues with the room and that it was not exactly what we had in mind for our four days in paris  we were given a reasonable upgrade that really made the difference in our stay  the staff were helpful and the hotel was really quite charming the location was perfect forthis was my second stay at this hotel and again it didnt disappoint friendly helpful staff nice and clean very central to a lot of attractions all within walking distance a metro station just around the corner for those longer trips  i will definitely be back againme and my friend stayed here for a short break for 4 nights the hotel itself was beautifully kept very nice and helpful staff who always had a smile on their faces  the only downside to the hotel itself is that there isnt anywhere to get a coffee apart from at breakfast and when we asked for milk they said they only had cream  as we were leaving our bathroom seemed to have acquired a number of ants not to sure where they were coming from i wouldve mentioned it but we had to check out  the eiffel tower notre damn champslyses and the main marathon is approximately 30 mins to 1 hour away by walking depending on if you stop to take in the sights   all in all a lovely little boutique guest house with lots of character friendly staff and quirky bits i wouldit was a pure pleasure to spent a weeekend in this charming hotel located in lovely neighbourhood close to bars cafes and restaurants walking distance to city centre and main attractions you wont be disappointed with superb customer service and lovely fresh tasty brrakfast i am sure you will fall in love with main restaurant and bar area where you can grab a glass of wine or cocktail on afternoon thank you for lovely stay and i look forward to back here again very sooni choose the brittany hotel because i remembered it from my first time in paris 30 years ago  that is true  naturally things change but when i looked it up and saw that it was still in existence read the reviews and saw the rate i booked it  i am very happy that i did  the hotel is a 5 minute walk from the notre dame de lorette metro stop in a nontouristy area of paris  if you want to exit your hotel and be among all the tourists and the most popular sights this might not be for you  but if youre like me and you want to walk the streets and feel as though you are in a real parisian neighborhood i would highly recommend it  it is a very short walk to the opera and the stores on blvd haussmann and a slightly longer but still reasonable walk up to montmartre  theno complaints the entire staff was very friendly and they were all bi or multi lingual i stayed in a cozy room so it was small but i wasnt in it very much the lift is tiny capacity three people but its not the end of the world if you have to let one person go up and wait for it to come back down  wifi worked fine was a little slow once or twice but nothing significant  bus and metro options are very nearby and its within walking distance of montmartre and three of the major train stations paris has a fantastic public transportation app so its really easy to catch a bus or the metro to the city center like around the eiffel tower theres a bakery right around the corner and lots of restaurants nearby as well  their early booking discount was phenomenal when ibooked 7 weeks prior for a 4 night stay was told on check in would have to move after 2 nights due to planned work surely should have planned the bookings better but as there was noisy work going on in the room above thought it would be better to move until we realised we were immediately below our original room so had noise again   the hotel is in a great area and we would stay in this area again the final straw was out airport taxi which we booked on day 2 reminded reception on day 3 and the final night only to be told half an hour before we were due to leave they nothing had been booked the very unhelpful man on reception just told us to try uber ourselves as everyone was on strike after checking the metro was running which it was but 5 changes with 4 casesthis hotel is very central in paris easy walking distance to the sacred heart cathedral positives the rooms are large for what you would expect in central paris and very clean the staff are friendly and helpful  neutral the elevator may be the smallest i have ever seen which i actually

            "stayed for a short city break  the hotel is a 1015 metro to the central for the eiffel tower and 5 minute taxi to notre dame  we did expect it to be quite far out but were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to all the usual sites so if you are looking for something a little quieter away from the centre hustle and bustle this is perfect  this hotel is a bit diy with complimentary tea and coffee and a serve yourself breakfast with fresh pastries ham pancakes and boiled eggs  perfect start to a long days sightseeing  the hotel decor is qwerky cool and classy whilst the rooms are cosey and just right for a short stay  staff were more than happy to accommodate our request of a balcony over looking the city roof tops and flowers as a surprise for my partner  thejust stayed 2 nights in this hotel and i loved its simplicity style location staff room lounge area and breakfast the only thing i was a little disappointed in was the small selection of food on our arrival back from the first day tired and hungry there was a small selection of wholesome snacks as they dont have cooking facilities and the food has to be preorderedwe saw others eating it and it looked delicious  again wholesome and home made i hesitate in recommending it as it is a jewel in a sea of expensive and crapy parisienne hotels strangely the staff were lovely all of them an achievement in paris where redness seems to be norm braviits pretty obvious the vast majority of reviews of this hotel on the internet are written by the management at first it comes off as chic in an odd way but then its clear its more about marketing than the hotel itself there are even weird signs everywhere encouraging guests to post photos on social media with the message be a good part of the community   true the room are cute like many boutique hotels its designed to look like a nice apartment rather than a hotel the bed is also more comfortable than most hotel beds however i was shocked when i arrived because the room was by far the smallest of any hotel room ive ever stayed in you have about one meter on either side of the bed and half that in front of it the door to the toilet doesnt even fully open thiswe absolutely loved our stay at coq hotel all the cute carefully considered little details extremely comfy bed pleasing shower and beautiful big window with a french balcony were just some reasons why we absolutely fell in love with this hotel it made our stay in paris even more memorable3we loved everything about our stay  the hotel is beautifully decorated and very stylish the room amenities are good including lovely toiletries and everything you need for a short stay the service was great  warm and welcoming and it is well located for metro lineswe had a brilliant stay at this hotel on our long weekend to paris it is really well decorated we loved our room massive comfy bed huge shower gorgeous carpet all very much to our tastes we got a really good deal that include a welcome drink which included a few glasses of good wine and super yummy popcorn the location is good near place ditalie so walkable to the left bank breakfast was fabulous really good quality produce the bread and butter was to die for lovely staff too we loved our stay so much we even bought a bottle of their wine as a souvenirwould definitely recommend had a room with a balcony overlooking paris rooftops breakfast is fantastic lots of choice of high quality products decor was modern and trendy and rooms were excellent sizeits hard to find enough superlatives for this hotel right from the check in to the check out we were greeted by friendly and smiling staff the room was small  as expected in paris  but with a reasonably large and nice bathroom everything was in good condition the breakfast was great not the biggest selection but quality items slightly cramped at times  a little wait for a table to be expected nice location in relation to metro lines and the neighborhood seemed peaceful and quiet and then i have to mention that several times we saw the staff go glass  knives and forks etc through to make sure it was perfectly clean  as it was at a michelin starred restaurant would love to stay here again another timewe stayed at the coq hotel for 4 nights in mid may it was as good as the photos and reviews suggest stylish but not pretentious friendly helpful service and a substantial breakfast   we upgraded to the superior room for extra space staying in such a special place we looked forward to coming back to the 13 arrondissement every evening after long days sightseeing in the citythis is without doubt one of the best located hotels we have stayed at in paris location is perfect for walking five minutes from metro with multiple lines converging so no part of paris is out of reach staff are wonderful along with very well maintained and clean premises could not be faultedthis is a lovely hotel the rooms are charming in a minimalist way clean and with plenty of natural light the rooms have windows that can be opened the hotel has an intimate feel yet there is plenty of public space to relax or do work its location close to the place ditalie provides good access to public transport and the staff were helpful in providing information on how to get around the staff are friendly energetic polite wellinformed and speak some english the 24 hour availability of light food options and a machine for tea and coffee is especially welcome the breakfast options are good and the staff accommodated my dietary needs punctually and without fuss  i had an extended stay for work and would certainly stay again this is a gem of a placewe loved this hotel and would highly recommend it for its friendly staff comfortable beds lovely rooms and amazing breakfasts very relaxed and comfortable and well placed in terms of metro station a place ditalie we paid for a larger room which is not so big but this is paris and for the price we paid the size and atmosphere of the room was very fair very large and comfortable bed the bathroom had a bad but no separate shower parking is easy in the neighbourghood and if you like to park in a paid garage prices are 14th the price of more central parisi thoroughly enjoyed my 3night stay at coq hotel in a quieter part of paris conveniently located nearby the place ditalie station with 3 metro lines  the classique room size is standard for paris hotels  it is the thoughtful use of space and design that actually makes staying at this hotel a truly pleasant experience equally the staff were very welcoming and always willing to help delivering quality service  the breakfast at the hotel is lovely and there are also some good food options in the 13eme arr for dinner nearby after a day out  overall an excellent stay i highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting paris and looking to have a standout boutique hotel experiencei was stuck in paris as there was a rail strike and needed a nice place to sit and wait until i was picked up i was looked after immediately upon walking through the door celia was an absolute star the lounge area is to the right of the reception and is cool contemporary and elegant i had the house wine which at 18 euros a bottle was well priced i also had the meat and cheese board for 15 euros which easily fed two adults with loads left over really generous the staff could not have been more friendly they were both fantastic i forget the other guys name but he was amazing too it was so lovely that i returned on the following thursday on the way back to orly and had a few coffees there i adore this hotel and will absolutely be back as soon as im able tothis hotel had everything that you might expect from a 5 star hotel in terms of service helpfulness and atmosphere at the hotel   the place felt like a home away from home with the welcime drink on offer and the boardgames the music was perfect and promoted a wonderfully relaxed ambience i would definitely come againwhat i like the staff overall atmosphere of the hotel and location if metro works bit remarks when there is a metro strike a bit far from centre of paris  room a bit too dark  no refrigerator is the room  bathroom does not have proper extractor in the ceiling price is fine thoughplace ditalie is great spot for good asian restaurants but with the metro only a couple of minutes to the center of paris  the interior is great especially the choice of colours we had the deluxe room with an antique bath very cool i recommend this hotel try the soft boiled bio egg in the morningthe hotel is beautiful and perfectly clean the rooms are gorgeous and the bathroom is a real pleasure  the breakfast is delicious and the staff is really nice helpful and friendly a really great place to stay in paris this is a very nice hotel with modern interior design and attentive staff breakfast was great and the common spaces were comfortable however the room was too small it was difficult cu walk around the bedone of the best hotels ive stayed at the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean and quiet the staff were all friendly a metro station is close

friendly a metro station is close by so very easy to get to all the sights we will definitely stay here againi am one of the coqs best customers with 20 stays but the coq lost my business   the coq is owned by 2 sugar heirswhose designers had a clever concept   community of quality [coq  rooster]  highlighting quirky decor and chickens that got lost when the hotel became a cash machine for the owners new upscale venture    i am genuinely fond of the staff who try their best  staff turnover has been significant an reallocated and it shows  the mascot pet silky chickens are dead 1 or rehomed 3  the flea market decor remains but the cool clientele is vanishing  the community of quality concept exists largely in merchandising and graphics  during the week photo and film shoots often  leave guests with nowhere to sit at weekend breakfast you can struggle tole coq hotel is located in the 13th district of paris an up and coming neighborhood just steps away from the place ditalie metro station from which you can easily access all the top sites in paris  the hotel lobby has a chic modern decor with velvet sofas cool artworks and interesting coffee table books giving it the air of a stylish cocktail bar theres even a sitting area full of plants and glass skylights which feels like a parisian glass menagerie and sitting room around a cozy fireplace breakfast is a sumptuous spread of fresh baguettes croissants configures fruit yogurt cheeses and meats served in the airy dining room at the front of the lobby the hotel has an elevator which for those of us me included that cant seem to leave home without a giantwe throughly enjoyed our stay at this cozy spot close to the 5  6 train if you are comfortable using the metro we are new yorkers then this is the hotel for you about a 1015 minute train ride to all the major attractions and very easy to transfer to the airport bound trains we loved the design of the hotel very chic very clean and super friendly staff i left my adapter at home and they were kind enough to let me borrow one you saved me from an awful hair day thank you they also do a complimentary glass of wine from 6pm8pm and have a coffee station that you can use anytime of day stay here you wont regret itfantastic hotel uber cool furnishings and vibe  location not as central but certainly worth the extra journey time to enjoy it staff were welcoming and friendly breakfast and drinks were superb enjoyed the experience (Score: 0.4773)\n",

            "the hotel is on a small beautiful unknown square right next to the cnam on the right bank close to grand boulevard st martin areas and super accessible from the gare du nord or montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsthis hotel was a great little find close to everything staff were amazing and very helpful hotel room was small but very clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my

nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this hotel is almost exactly halfway between gare d est and gare d nord excuse spelling  there is a food store three doors down  the breakfast buffet was delicious and very

quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord

is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly

sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back (Score: 0.2157)\n",

and the hostel is nice everything is clean and the beds are nice  the only thing is that you have to bring your own padlock to lock your suitcase so remember to bring that didnt get to try the food just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese and wine night a very pleasant

get to know other people also the staff is incredibly friendly and create a great atmosphere especially barry he made our stay even more enjoyable with his kindness and hospitality good food good location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our last night so bad  i will never step foot in here againive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems

montparnasse via the line 4   ive stayed here several times and always had a really nice view of the square   the staff is very welcoming and competentthe little palace hotel as its name suggests is small the rooms are quite tiny and there isnt much if any closet space but it wonderfully located and a beautiful spot if youre looking for a grand hotel this isnt for you but if you are looking for a nice little room to relax in when youre not walking the city i highly recommend this hotel i dont think it would be large enough for two people but for one it is enough room the staff was very helpful and kind and its minutes from wonderful shops and cafes i will definitely come back my personal favorite was the small terrace where i took my coffee in the morningthe perfect hotel to me in paris as the best location clean and amazing staff it not fussy but to an elegant high standard it makes your trip feel wonderful and special i visit and recommend to everyone as it makes your paris trip even more perfectcomfortable nicely designed rooms   we had a superior room on 6th floor overlooking the pretty park and with a balcony although there are busy roads nearby the double glazing cuts out the traffic noise no kettle in room but they were very happy to send up a pot of boiling water for us to make tea excellent breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff close to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placethe little palace hotel as its

to 3 metro stations and near plenty of good restaurantsthis hotel was a great little find close to everything staff were amazing and very helpful hotel room was small but very clean and comfortable breakfast available at a reasonable price would definitely stay againhad a lovely stay at this cozy boutique hotel for 5 nights our room was small its paris but lovely designed clean comfortable and functioned well we had a nice view toward the park square and it was lovely staff was nice and attentive hotel was reasonably priced considering paris and its location close to marais we tried the hotel breakfast and it had decent options all in all it was a pleasant staythe hotel itself is what id expect from a paris establishment  small and old the foyer area is lovely and the room we stayed in overlooked a park which can be quite noisy at times the room was pretty small but thats paris location is great  10 minute walk to the river close to the metro and plenty attractions close bythe room was small and the bathroom was tiny and all was a bit dated but the value was good the location was awesome the subway was super convenient the bed was comfortable we did not try their breakfast the water was hot and the pressure was good the staff was awesome they spoke very good english and were very friendly and personablethis is a small but friendly hotel whose selling point is its location it is in the 4th arrondisement and within walking distance of lots of shops bars and restaurants and right next door to the reaumur sebastopol metro stop on line 4 this is just one stop from chatelet les halles and the rer line b which is a direct regional train to cdg airport the hotel itself overlooks a small square and is on a side streetsquare just off two main roads which means there wasnt as much traffic noise plus excellent blackout curtains mean that it was easy to sleep all the staff we encountered were polite friendly and keen to help and please the rooms themselves are small but contain everything youd need and were very cleantop floor up to floor 8 rooms have the best views as doroom very small but standard for paris furniture were old and stained walls  bathroom remember to bring your own shampoo cream etc no facilities and just a very old hairdryer  cleaning found hair on the bed and in the bathroom not impressed  breakfast for 15 euros i just recommend go somewhere else  staff kind and helpful location excellent in walking distance to central paris and many restaurants  conclusion we are not coming backwe had a lovely stay at this hotel location is good and the room was nice reception staff were friendly and helpful the foyer had such a lovely scent from the beautiful flowers that were there would definately stay againwe stayed here for 4 nights and to be honest could have stayed alot longer  location wise this hotel was perfect and had loads of bars and shops within walking distance  the staff were very friendly and helpful  our room was stunning and had a lovely patio area with chairs to sit and relax in although in feb it was too cold but in the summer i imagine it would be perfect room 57  the only downside to our stay was that there wasnt any teacoffee making facilities and there wasnt much storage  i would definitely recommend this placevery pleasant stay at the little palace hotel friendly staff nice rooms and good breakfast nice surroundings such as lovely park with fountain at the opposite of the hotel close to nice restaurants and shopping areas such as the maraisi had searched to find a reasonably priced hotel on this area as we were on a tour that ended near here what a nice surprise to discover the little palace hotel the location is convenient for walking or riding the metro  we had a lovely room on the top floor overlooking the park very comfortable and clean bathroom wasnt large but that is what is expected in european hotels the front desk was very pleasant and helpful with directions  the breakfast may not be worth 15 euro but we had a rate that included it and it was fine i would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friendswhere do i start created an account just to make this review i booked 25 months ahead of time and got a decent rate of 1303usd for 4 nights in the suite definately not a suite which is why ive put it in quotations we stayed at nh collection in rome immediately prior to this in the panorama suite now that is a suite and i miss it already i cant imagine the unfortunate people who have gotten smaller rooms as im sure their experience is worse   1 the noise you can hear absolutely everything my neighbors upstairs stay up until 1 or 2 every night and you can hear all the footsteps and heavy creaks with the old wood it sounds like a walrus moving furniture they also get up early so that means no good sleep for you you can also hear their coughs it sounds likewe stayed 3 nights here and the rooms were clean and the beds were great staff was nice and friendly we had a little balcony overlooking the park below which was awesome i missed having a little coffee andor tea station in the room though as it would have been nice to enjoy a morning coffee in the room without having to go to the reception to buy one also a flat iron would have been nice the breakfast was not worth the 15 euros but we just went elsewhere to get breakfast neighborhood is fantastic with a metro right next to the hotel all in all id come back to stay here i just think a 4 star hotel needs that little extra i booked little palace hotel as part of the british airways sale package for my girlfriends birthday trip to paris this was our first stay in paris and the hotel seemed to be a good option considering the price per night for the location   the staff are extremely friendly whether it be the receptionconcierge who speak a variety of languages or the catererscleaners for instance they helped with directions and recommendations for restaurants etc  however upon arrival when we checked in and went up to our room we unexpectedly opened the door to one of the hotels handymen who was just as surprised as us reception had evidently failed to notify either of us so we had to wait outside our room for 10 mins or so whilst he finished initially this did not bother us toostaff is super nice  rooms are super cramped no natural light breakfast is not included very sneaky about this  this is not an inexpensive hotel but it sure felt like it  no way to call front desk no restaurant rooms are very different  im not one to post  good or bad  but i was kind of shocked at how this 500night hote felt like a hostel  too bad marais neighborhood is awesome thoughwe booked a superior double room with a balcony our room faced the front of the hotel and we had a magnificent view from the balcony of paris it was breathe taking our room was a good size for two adults and   it was very clean and so old world charm  and beauty the staff was very friendly and most helpful with all of our questions or concerns the location was perfect very close to all tourist attractions centre of the city if you choose to have their breakfast you are provided with a lovely variety of choices it is simply delicious highly recommendedfirst i booked myself into this hotel on bookingcom and regretted that i stayed in there second and last time i again booked myself in there totally by mistake hopefully there will not be a third one it is a small cozy hotel  way too cozy  matresses  bed sheets and comforters are old and not very comforting good for vloggers and backpackers but i can not tell the same thing if you are on bizz or pleasure tripa nice old cozy paris hotel with good location lovely view of small green area with fountain we already felt welcome in the lobby beautiful bar and invitting breakfast room very friendly and helpfull staff the only thing we could have wanted was a little more closet space in the roomsuch a cute boutique hotel and staff are friendly close to a metro and only half hour walk to the louvre clean and very comfortable  recommend getting a taxi from the station if coming off from the eurostar because even though the hotel was in a nice area round by the station felt a little unsafemy teenage daughter and i stayed at this hotel for three nights in april the staff was really friendly and helpful we felt very welcomed the room small but clean and instagram friendly with nice decor and a small balcony viewing the park quiet and safe neighborhoodexcellent hotel amazing location clean rooms and great service the view from the room was extraordinary we will definitely return to this hotel there is a metro station nearby but we preferred to walkthis is my second time at the little palace hotel  im a creature of habit especially in far and away places  i feel like i have a home here when in paris and that is because of the great location and furthermore the staff  for the second year in a row i got to deal with mamoud who is very friendly  the rest of the staff are great as well including the lovely ladies from housekeeping who wait downstairs with a smile as you remove the do not disturb tag and head outdoors  i get exceptional rest at this hotel as it is nice and quiet  and for the location youre in a great place with wonderful views from your room  when i visit paris this is now my home\n",

would love to stay there againthis is the second time we stayed in this hotel and we were again very satisfied location and service are very good from the gare de lest you can easily walk to the hotel  as last time we had a room to the inner court that was very calmgreat place to visit paris clean romantic rooms amazing staff good breakfastbuffet love this place 5stars this hotel is close to gare du nord train and metro on walking distance a lot of restaurants surrounding the hotel even a great market with oysters and wines a supermarket next to the hotelwithin walking distance of the gare du nord in a road appropriately called the street of small hotels the hotel frontage is very small  so is the rest of it  tall and narrow built around a small courtyard rooms are small but well equipped and the breakfast buffet is  by french standards at least  quite reasonable scrambled eggs bacon and sausage very helpful staff at receptioni spent three nights in this well located hotel  the team was warm and really helpful also sanitizer and masks are available for customers  the room was of decent size for a hotel downtown top notch quality matress  i highly recommend this hotelstylish and warm boutique hotel just 5 minute walk away from gare du nord and gare de lest   rooms were nice and we had a nice view on the parisian style buildings on the other side of the street   from the hotel you can easily walk to the le marais neighbourhood and canal st martin which are both very nice areas   breakfast was not very special and it took a long time before we got served but i guess this is due to corona and that in normal times there is a buffet where you can help yourself  i did not use the spa so cannot comment on that  will be backgreat little hotel walking dinstance from gare du nord and the lovely street in the 9th arrondissement small but very clean rooms with good beds very friendly and professional staff we had a great staywe only had one night in paris and needed to hit the sights prior to our check in time and the reception staff at the hotel were very friendly and allowed us to store our case until we came back to the hotel later that evening we also had use of the comfortable lounge after our check out time and prior to our departure on the eurostar the following evening  a very nice stylish hotel conveniently situated we would definitely stay again if we came back to pariswe stayed here a few years back  returnded as it left such a geat memory for us  amazing stay made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this hotel is almost exactly halfway between gare d est and gare d nord excuse spelling  there is a food store three doors down  the breakfast buffet was delicious and very filling   the staff was very helpful answering some local travel questions  t was able to reserve a room at a very large discount  not sure how long these will last as travelers emerge from covid19

quiet which is a miracle considering its right in the centre of the city you practically fall out of gare du nord and into the hotel it has a big atrium where you can have breakfast the breakfast itself was a dream for someone who loves croissants and pain au chocolat on top of that the room was well acd and dont even get me started on the good water pressure i got in the shower its the perfect place for a trip to pariseverything in this hotel is superb value for money cleanliness  the staff could not be more helpful  everybody was excellent but a special thank you to garmial at

made special by the staff here it may be a bit too central for some but we love that and the vibrancy that comes with it this was my first visit to france let alone paris and i definitely picked the right hotel within easy walking distance from gare du nord we found the hotel in a back street location which left a bit to be desired the frontage looks a little run down which concerned me but as soon as you walk through the front door youre in a clean well presented reception area with an extremely well presented polite efficient humorous english speaking receptionist i understand that not all reception staff speak as good english as the young man we encountered all the staff we encountered were exceptionally polite and couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable in fact id go as far to say that they were more than happy to go out of their way for their guests our room 307 waswe stayed for 3 nights room was large enough with a really big comfortable double bed bathroom and shower not walkin was sizeable the staff all of them are excellent nothing is too much the two restaurant recommendations nearby were both superb  you are located around 10 mins slow walk from gare du nord so perfect for eurostar or airport with rer connection there is a food market less than a minutes walk away  the breakfast is wide ranging lots of choice dont think they have evening restaurant option but they will put out a lovely meats  cheese  salmon platter on request delicious after a good days sight seeing their small bar area is a cosy place to have a couple of drinks before retiring for the evening they advertise a spa but we did not use sohad a short stay at this hotel its clean and comfortable located close to gard de nord and gard de est beaning getting the metro is convenient   access to the gym was disappointing as they whole gym was booked for classes  also no weights machines  breakfast options were good and athe staff were very politei have rarely come across a boutique hotel as friendly and caring at the same time they take away all of your cares and worries in the world and help to make your stay with them better than you ever imagined   the staff is not a staff they are a familya lovely hotel great location for our visit superb service throughout especially upon check in and check out very good value for money clean throughout and good wifi i highly recommend this hotelwe will be back when we need a hotel in paris for a short business trip business partner was convinced as well next time we will try the breakfast so cant comment on that  clean room bathroom maybe a little too smallwe typically stay at homeawayaitbnb type places but we thought wed give a hotel a try during our second paris trip we are so glad we did the staff was beyond accommodating typically i get names and i neglected to do so every interaction we had with staff was really pleasantentertaining   we checked in the morning of 112020 our room wasnt ready and the front desk person offered to store our luggage until our room was ready within minutes he found us a room without our asking which was an upgrade at no additional charge he had a dry sense of humor that my wife and i found entertaining and thought he was very personable as we waiting for the elevator we heard a crash noise from inside the elevator shaft and the elevator stopped afraid someone may havegreat for being able to walk with luggage to and from eurostar at gare du nord  extremely helpful staff able to leave bags and collect for departure later than time of vacating the room  excellent breakfast for france  very comfortable bed next to the local market for the arondisment which is worth a visit  perhaps a little aspirationally priced but this is paris for youwe were looking for a boutique hotel close to gare du nord for a trip from charles de gaulle we found hotel mademoiselle with tripadvisors help so glad we did  excellent location walking distance from train and underground front staff excellent and rooms clean and sparkling excellent highly recommendstayed here for 2 nights and chose it as it close to the eurostar terminal but on a quiet street feels like a world away from it  location was great lovely locals food market less than a minute away hotel was clean and funky with a cute little bar room was clean and i was lucky enough to be upgraded to a larger room for my stay staff were really friendly and accommodating  basically there wasnt a single thing i could fault  would definitely go backconveniently situated right next to gare du nord near the first day lunch placebrasserie flodere and easy to get elsewhere just lovely helpful staff which makes all the difference  nothing too much trouble and super friendly also great

is minimal noise from the street outside the nearest metro station is around 10 mins walking and links to anywhere in the city  there is no installed air conditioning but rooms have fans that are quiet and keep you cool on warm days  would not hesitate to book here againnice clean modern rooms small but to be expected in pairs shop across the road cute restaurant s and bakery nearby  not too far from the city my partner is french said the area is not too good but ok for a short stay staff very helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricewe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus right into the heart of paris loads of little eateries around and right across the road from a minimarket  highly recommended and i would absolutely stay there againnice clean modern rooms small but

helpful  my room was not ready when i arrived is a down side as all you want to do is relax and freshing up after a flight i had to wait a half a hour but i would recommend it for a short side note its not in the city its outside the city bus service nearby 15 min drive to city louve  not too far from all the paris lifemyself and my partner are hotel perfectionists if something isnt right we will always complain in order to amend our issues however there were zero faults with this hotel it delivered way more than expected in terms of cleanliness style and location rooms were bigger than expected i had previously set myself up for a bed with no floor space at all however it was spacious enough really quirky vibe  very friendly reception staff on our last day a gentleman with glasses was very attentive to us even after our checkout would highly recommend this hotel given its very affordable pricehorrible most disgusting service i have ever encountered the night time attendant mohammad was just awful my friends and i went out for a night out and had to go wait outside for 20 minutes because of a sleeping mohammad he came to the door with his shirt wrinkled and looking super sketchy and dishoveled i checked out and immediately noticed i left my passport with a bag of important documents in the safe i called mohammad and he not so convincingly told me the safe was closed and empty which was a complete lie the safe was open he hung up abruptly without giving me further information super sketchy and unfortunate because the day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripwe stayed there for 3 nights the room is good enough clean and well presented but the bathroom is really small and cumbersome women should take their hair dryer with them because theres not one but what really let me down is the breakfast its bad cheap not enough choices tastes bad too well its bad in every way i advise you to forget about taling the breakfast option because youll be better of eating that outside with the same brice but much betteri was fully prepared for a bit of a dump  having booked the cheapest place i could find in paris but i was pleasantly surprised small but clean comfortable bed good shower decent breakfast for the extra charge 24hour manned desk all of whom were really friendly and helpful  the location is great too grab a 90 bus

day time attend imed was a nice guy thanks for ruining my paris tripthis was okay for a few nights the rooms are even smaller than london standard didnt think that was possible would not stay in this hotel again however the area was really great would stay there again for sureroom was tidy we both felt it small for a double room and was next to the main road you could hear the cars and sirens all night some staff at reception were helpful others not so next to the bus stops but a good 10min walk to the metro nothing to visit apart from cafes takeaway and electronic shops a basic understanding of french would be advisablei was surprised at how cheap the hotel was to stay in but for how much we paid it was great the bed linen and towels were changed every day it was very cleanquiet and both of us slept very well the hotel is in a good location a few minutes walk to joules joffrin metro which gives easy access to the centre the only downfall was that the room was small but thats paris and that we would have liked a kettle in the room so we could make our own teacoffeei stayed here for 2 nights on business the weather was extremely hot and the hotel rooms do not have air conditioning and even with the window open and the fan the temperature was almost unbearable for sleeping or working the room was small with basic facilities typical for paris breakfast was generally good and staff were mostly pleasant and helpful as other reviewers have said the area is rather unpleasant overall not bad but colleagues stayed in nicer hotels hotels for a similar budgetlovely hotel with very helpful staff the rooms are a bit small but thats to be expected in paris the location was excellent with many lovely restaurants nearby i would not hesitate in recommending this hoteli had a lovely stay at the hotel lumieres lovely district if montmatreit was very cosy modern and beautiful and cleanstaff were very efficient and nicei was able to have an inclusive breakfast with much choice to set me up for the day there was a coffee machine and snack machine which was very handy the price was reasonable toowe stayed here for two nights and found nothing to complain we only dealt with friendly and helpfull staff our room was a little bit small but nice it was well equiped and clean its a bit tricky to find the parking and to find your way out but its worth it the location is great busstop right in front 10 min walk to the next metrostation right next 2 supermarkets 2 min up the street a bistro a good italian restaurant and if you want to only 1015 min walk to sacre coeur we liked this hotel very much and recommed it strongly be aware in paris you want find a hotel under 10000 with 5 stars so when you want more you have to pay morewe stayed at the hotel lumieres for three nights it was very tiny which we expected the rooms were clean and tidy our sons room had a light switch missing and the tv remote didnt work but if you are english that wouldnt really matter anyway seeing as there were no english speaking channels available and our desk wouldnt stay up because the clip had broken but they werent things that would affect our stay too much we didnt have breakfast as at 10 per person we thought it quite steep for a croissant so went to the supermarket directly opposite and bought breakfast for four for 6 we thought we had chosen a pretty area of montmartre but actually it was anything but it was full of kebab shops and graffiti but if you walk 15 minutes up towards the sacre coeur you canwe stayed in the hotel for 5 days we found a very good deal on the website the room was very clean no road noise even if the room was facing the road good curtains made the room pitch black and had all the necessities that you might need during your stay  breakfast was very good with pastries jams nutella yogurts but also cheese ham and fruits  our stay was lovely good location with loads of places to visit nearby and bus stop and tube station very close we had an incredible value for the money but the best part of our stay was the staff i made a last minute reservation and i was in contact with a very polite gentleman that reassured me that everything was ok before our flight to paris everyone speaks english and that really saved us since we do not speak frenchthis hotel is lovely staff are very friendly and our room was extremely clean the hotel is in a good location to explore montmartre the hotel is situated very close to public transport taking you into the centre of paris we used the bus which dropped us right outside the louvre and was extremely cheap hotel room was a reasonable size for a city hotel one of the best ive stayed in the reception staff also booked us a shuttle back to the airport which was cheaper than a taxi would definitely recommend this hotela very pleasant 5 night stayroom 306 street facing roomroom was spotless  had all that you need for your staythe little soap bars  shower gel etc are quality productswe had no problems sleeping the bed was superwe opted to eat breakfast here every morning10 euro eachthis represented good value for money there is a small supermarket across from the hotel if you need anything from gar du nord station its around a 25 minute walk if you feel up to itwe chose to walk all the time during our stay  had no problems seeing all we came to see walking from the hotel every day thank you for a wonderful staygreat stay clean and comfortable with towels changed everyday and a helpful staff its a bit far from the city centre but the neighborhood is quite safe and quiet no reason to worry the underground and the busses let you reach all main attractions prices below paris average will recommend  just a tip if you want to have a cheap but huge breakfast just go to the patisserie round the corner its awesomeit was a visit of 5 days no elevator service for 2 days not so good breakfast very small room no airconditioning and the worst no changing the sheets which is very important however good staff close to bus stops and about 10 minutes from metro stations not a bad choose for a couple of medium income but it could be better i hope they improve their services because there is a lot of potential i am leaving a review of 2 stars due to the sheets i really believe its very important to change in a stay of more than 2 daysextremely pleasant and helpful staff comfortable small but immaculately clean rooms which cater for your needs when most of the time is spent sight seeing etc a good continental breakfast situated in montmartre close to sacre cur 10 minutes walk from the metro station and then 15 minutes to the centre many restaurants available locally for an evening meal including le chat des oliviers which was excellent we would definitely stay here againwe stayed at the hotel lumieres montmarte for 2 nights in early january being an annual trip to paris we decided to try and stay somewhere different the location was great only a 1015 walk from port de clignancourt metro station m4 and literally just around the corner from the bus31 stop there is a supermarket directly opposite as well as one 2 doors down there are also a number of pharmacies and tabac shops for any other immediate needs  the rooms were warm and cosy enough room for 2 people having stayed in paris a number of times i understand that you can quite often be pushed for space however the rooms offered plenty room for storing baggage and coats  meaning that there was plenty of open space the bathroom was sufficient with an overhead shower and avery handy for my family this hotel is close to montmarte staff were very friendly and helpful the room was very clean with lovely smooth sheets and an excellent mattress so slept very well good shower although small but i could not get the two shower heads to work individually and i have this set up at home so know how it works i told the receptionist but it wasnt fixed there is a small wardrobe with just a few hangers and no drawers just a shelf but thats fine for a few days i dont take breakfast so i liked the fact that this was extra as im not paying for something i dont have apart from the shower problem it was a really good stay and i would come back again oh and theres a supermarket right opposite and cafes and restaurants all aroundthe staff were very helpful especially george we did struggle with directions but that was our struggle  the hotel was in  neighborhood which we liked  wish we had visited the cool places in montmartre but ran out of timei stayed here with a friend whilst we visited paris for 4 days in august the hotel is located slightly out of the centre close sacre coeur and the metro station jules joffrin is a ten minute walk which will take you to all the main attractions   the hotel is nice and comfortable with all needed amenities and the staff are friendly and welcoming the rooms are small but as to be expected in paris and fine as a place to base yourself whilst visiting the sites of the city the shower is great and we had a large comfortable double bed   highly recommend as a base whilst visiting the city for a few daysmy family and i stayed for a night and in that stay we experienced beautiful clean rooms a delicious breakfast but most notably a warm and hospitable staff who went out of their way to call around for a specific dish we were wanting for dinner if given the chance we will definitely come back\n",

just go herebarry made my night cant recommend enough i cant get into specifics even though trip advisor requires 200 character which is annoying by the way i as an irish american from new york i was honored to meet a real irish person in the beautiful city of parisbarry is the best bartender in paris cheers great bar the food was amazing drinks have good prices and they atmosphere is always great music is good and you always meet new and nice people come to belushis gare du nord asap beautiful hostel with nice people and a cool atmosphere barry made the cheese and wine night a very pleasant

location special regards to my friend barry the barman very very nice 100 recommended  nevertheless tripadvisor obliges me to write 200 words as minimum wich is bloody ridiculousprivate room is extremely satisfactory great location in the city with ease of access to all amenities coming from the uk we find it hard to communicate in french but the bartender barry gave us many suggestions on the local area and made our stay at the bar a great night hats off to him for great servicei usually like hostels as they are more affordable and social compared to hotels a tradeoff in comfort is part of the deal  unfortunately this hostel was not for me the signiture barnightclub of st christophers inn is located at the hart of the hostel giving al rooms with a courtyard view entertainmant throuought the night good if you like to party the night away but not if you just want a decent nights sleep  additionally i was grossed out by my pillows even though they had clean cassings the verry sharp sweat odor was unbearable   not my best hostel experiencewonderful hostel everythings clean and the people are so nice even in a 10 bed room very good to stay there  especially the barkeeper barry made us feel welcome and made sure everyone was socializing well  also the train station is 2 minutes away which was very good when ill go to paris next time i know where im gonna stayi have only had the pleasure of spending one night at the st christophers inn but i have had so much fun and made so many friends  if you are looking for parisian nightlife this is the place to go   we were given a free workshop on making mojitos by barry it was so awesome  i would recommend this hostel to any students traveling on a budget looking to have some funwe really enjoyed our recent stay at st christophers inn the hostel was perfect for our needs and located close to the train station one of the highlights of our stay in paris was an evening spent in the adjoining bar where our fellow irishman  barry made sure the drink was flowing and everyone was in good form i would definitely recommend this hostel and bar  ive been in hostels and dormitories around the world for more then 20 years i would not go back to this place it is huge and the reception seems to take it as an argument for the bathrooms to be uncleaned showers and toilets were not clean corridors have no end and you have to pass multiple doors from the elevator to finally get to your room i felt like i was sleeping in a warehouse there was no air con and some people had problems with their windows that would not open good to mention that gare du nord is a crappy neighborhoodsuch a good vibe at the hostel a perfect place to meet new people and socialise  easy when bartender barry is on the job making sure everyone is having fun and never an empty glass i can only recommend this place to all travelling by yourself or with a friendamazing staff and customer service the trip was amazing the customer service was amazing you are greeted at reception by lovely staff and the atmosphere as amazing  5 star would defo about visit againparry the irish was great he taught us how to make mojitos and made us feel very welcome here we met lots of people from around the world and there was just a really great vibe inside the bar with all the other travelers we hope to go to stchristophers inn in other countrieswhen we made a reservation and went to the hotel they said that it was impossible for us to pay cash and that was the procedure  another customer who was there asked to pay to help us and we were going to give him cash  but the woman at the reception said very harshly that such a thing was not possible it was our last day in paris or even in france  we were in a panic and they were never helpful  they were very rude  they took cash payment for the two people who came after us but they told us it was impossible the rudest owner people i have ever seen i am so unhappy that they made our
