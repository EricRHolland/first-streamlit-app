"October 9, 2021",50,Music was perfect,As any HR you expect to be overwhelmed by the memorabilia throughout. Had a bloody Mary at the bar. Good quick service. Drink wasn't bad t start the day. The music wasn't so loud you couldn't talk. It was just right

"March 17, 2020",50,It's not noisy,"It may sound noisy initially but if you find a good place at the bar, the noises fade away and you can enjoy the company of your partner. One of the best Hard Rock Cafes one finds anywhere in the world."
"March 13, 2020",40,Good burger and unique atmosphere,"I had a very good burger here. The atmosphere is unique but do not expect hard rock music, there were more rap and pop video clips than rock."
"February 24, 2020",30,!00 people for breakfast,"We pre arranged breakfast for 100 people and they opened at 7am for us. Normal opening time is 8am. Standard USA breakfast, nothing special but was good enough for us before a long day in New York."
